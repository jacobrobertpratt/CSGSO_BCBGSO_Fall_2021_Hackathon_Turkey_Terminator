An angin is ealra þinga, þæt is God Ælmihtig
There is one origin of all things, that is God Almighty
1 2

He is ordfruma and ende: he is ordfruma, forði þe he wæs æfre
He is beginning and end: he is beginning, because he was ever

he is ende butan ælcere geendunge, forðan þe he bið æfre ungeendod
he is end without any ending, because he is ever unended

He is ealra cyninga Cyning, and ealra hlaforda Hlaford
He is King of all kings, and Lord of all lords

He hylt mid his mihte heofonas and eorðan, and ealle gesceafta butan geswince, and he besceawað þa niwelnyssa þe under þyssere eorðan sind
He holdeth with his might heavens, and earth, and all creatures, without toil, and he beholdeth the depths which are under this earth

He awecð ealle duna mid anre handa, and ne mæg nan þing his willan wiðstandan
He weigheth all hills with one hand, and no thing may withstand his will

Ne mæg nan gesceaft fulfremedlice smeagan ne understandan ymbe god: Maran cyððe habbað englas to Gode þonne men, and þeah-hweðere hí ne magon fulfremedlice understandan ymbe God
No creature may perfectly search out nor understand concerning God: greater affinity have angels to God than men, and yet they may not perfectly understand concerning God

Hé gesceop gesceafta þaða he wolde
He created those creatures that he would

þurh his wisdom he geworhte ealle þing, and þurh his willan hé hí ealle geliffæste
through his wisdom he wrought all things, and through his will he endued them all with life

Ðeos þrynnys is án God, þæt is se Fæder and his wisdom of him sylfum æfre acenned
This Trinity is one God, that is, the Father, and his Wisdom, of himself ever produced

and heora begra willa, þæt is se Halga Gast: he nis na acenned, ac he gæð of þam Fæder and of þam Suna gelice
and the Will of them both, that is, the Holy Ghost: he is not born, but he goeth alike from the Father and from the Son

Ðas þry hadas sindon án Ælmihtig God, se geworhte heofenas, and eorðan, and ealle gesceafta
These three persons are one Almighty God, who wrought the heavens, and the earth, and all creatures

He gesceop tyn engla werod, þæt sind englas and heah-englas, throni, dominationes, principatus, potestates, uirtutes, cherubim, seraphim
He created ten hosts of angels, that is angels and archangels, throni, dominationes, principatus, potestates, virtutes, cherubim, seraphim

Her sindon nigon engla werod: hí nabbað nænne lichaman, ac hí sindon ealle gastas swiðe strange and mihtige and wlitige, on micelre fægernysse gesceapene, to lofe and to wurðmynte heora Scyppende
Here are nine hosts of angels: they have no body, but they are all spirits, very strong, and mighty, and beautiful, formed with great fairness, to the praise and glory of their Creator

Ðæt teoðe werod abreað and awende on yfel
The tenth host rebelled and turned to evil

God hí gesceop ealle góde, and let hí habban agenne cyre, swa hí heora Scyppend lufedon and filigdon, swa hí hine forleton
God created them all good, and let them have their own discretion, whether they would love and follow their Creator, or would forsake him

Ða wæs þæs teoðan werodes ealdor swiðe fæger and wlitig gesceapen, swa þæt hé wæs geháten Leohtberend
Now the prince of the tenth host was formed very fair and beauteous, so that he was called 'Light-bearing' (Lucifer)

Þa began he to modigenne for þære fægernysse þe he hæfde, and cwæð on his heortan þæt hé wolde and eaðe mihte beon his Scyppende gelic, and sittan on þam norð-dæle heofenan rices, and habban andweald and rice ongean God Ælmihtigne
Then he began to wax proud by reason of the comeliness that he had, and said in his heart that he would and easily might be equal to his Creator, and sit in the north part of heaven's kingdom, and have power and sway against God Almighty

Þa gefæstnode he þisne ræd wið þæt werod þe hé bewiste, and hí ealle to ðam ræde gebugon
Then he confirmed this resolve with the host over which he ruled, and they all bowed to that resolve

Ðaða hí ealle hæfdon þysne ræd betwux him gefæstnod, þa becom Godes grama ofer hí ealle, and hí ealle wurdon awende of þam fægeran híwe, þe hí on gesceapene wæron, to laðlicum deoflum
When they all had confirmed this resolve among themselves, God's anger came over them all, and they were all changed from the fair form in which they were created to loathly devils

And swiðe rihtlice him swa getimode, þaða he wolde mid modignysse beon betera þonne he gesceapen wæs, and cwæð, þæt he mihte beon þam Ælmihtigum Gode gelíc
And very rightly it so befell him, when he would in pride be better than he was created, and said that he might be equal to Almighty God

Þa wearð he and ealle his geferan forcuþran and wyrsan þonne ænig oðer gesceaft
Then became he and all his associates more wicked and worse than any other creatures

and þa hwile þe he smeade hu he mihte dælan rice wið God, þa hwile gearcode se Ælmihtiga Scyppend him and his geferum helle wíte, and hí ealle adræfde of heofenan rices myrhðe, and let befeallan on þæt ece fyr, þe him gegearcod wæs for heora ofermettum
and while he meditated how he might share power with God, the Almighty Creator prepared hell-torment for him and his associates, and drove them all from the joy of heaven's kingdom, and caused them to fall into the eternal fire that was prepared for them for their pride

Þa sona þa nigon werod, þe ðær to lafe wæron, bugon to heora Scyppende mid ealre eaðmodnesse, and betæhton heora rǽd to his willan
Then forthwith the nine hosts that were left bowed to their Creator with all humbleness, and resigned their purpose to his will

Þa getrymde se Ælmihtiga God þa nigon engla werod, and gestaþelfæste swa þæt hí næfre ne mihton ne noldon syððan fram his willan gebugan
Then the Almighty God confirmed and established the nine hosts of angels, so that they never might or would afterwards swerve from his will

ne hí ne magon nu, ne hí nellað nane synne gewyrcan, ac hi æfre beoð ymbe þæt án, hu hi magon Gode gehyrsumian, and him gecweman
nor can they now perpetrate any sin, but they are ever meditating only how they may obey God and be acceptable to him

Swa mihton eac þa oðre þe ðær feollon dón, gif hi woldon
So might also the others who fell have done if they had been willing

forþi ðe God hí geworhte to wlitegum engla gecynde, and let hí habban agenne cyre, and hí næfre ne gebigde ne ne nydde mid nanum þingum to þam yfelan ræde
seeing that God had made them of the beauteous nature of angels, and let them have their own will, and would never have inclined nor forced them in any way to that evil counsel

ne næfre se yfela rǽd ne com of Godes geþance, ac com of þæs deofles, swa swa we ǽr cwædon
for the evil counsel never came from God's conception, but came from the devil's, as we before said

Nu þencð menig man and smeað hwanon deofol come
Now many a man will think and inquire, whence the devil came

þonne wite he þæt God gesceop to mæran engle þone þe nu is deofol: ac God ne gesceop hine na to deofle
be it, therefore, known to him that God created as a great angel him who is now the devil: but God did not create him as the devil: but when he was wholly fordone and guilty towards God, through his great haughtiness and enmity, then became he changed to the devil, who before was created a great angel

ac þaða he wæs mid ealle fordón and forscyldgod þurh þa miclan up-ahefednysse and wiðerweardnysse, þa wearð he to deofle awend, seðe ǽr wæs mære engel geworht
Then would God supply and make good the loss that had been suffered in the heavenly host, and said that he would make man of earth, so that the earthly man should prosper, and merit with meekness those dwellings in the kingdom of heaven which the devil through his pride had forfeited

Ða wolde God gefyllan and geinnian þone lyre þe forloren wæs of þam heofenlicum werode, and cwæð þæt hé wolde wyrcan mannan of eorðan, þæt se eorðlica man sceolde geþeon and geearnian mid eadmodnysse þa wununga on heofenan rice, þe se deofol forwyrhte mid modignysse
And God then wrought a man of clay, and blew spirit into him, and animated him, and he became a man formed with soul and body

And God þa geworhte ænne mannan of láme, and him on ableow gast, and hine gelíffæste, and he wearð þa mann gesceapen on sawle and on lichaman
and God bestowed on him the name of Adam, and he was for some time standing alone

and God him sette naman Adám, and he wæs þa sume hwile ánstandende
God then brought him into Paradise, and established him there, and said unto him

God þa hine gebrohte on neorxna-wange, and hine þær gelogode, and him to cwæð
Of all the things which are in Paradise thou mayest eat, and they shall all be committed to thee, save one tree which stands in the middle of Paradise: touch thou not the fruit of this tree

Ealra þæra þinga þe on neorxna-wange sindon þu most brucan, and hí ealle beoð þe betæhte, buton anum treowe þe stent on middan neorxna-wange: ne hrepa þu þæs treowes wæstm, forþan ðe þu bist deadlic, gif ðu þæs treowes wæstm geetst
for thou shalt be mortal if thou eatest the fruit of this tree

Hwí wolde God swa lytles þinges him forwyrnan, þe him swa miccle oðre þing betæhte
Why would God forbid him so little a thing, when he had committed to him other things so great

Gyse hu mihte Adám tocnawan hwæt hé wære, buton hé wære gehyrsum on sumum þince his Hlaforde
But how could Adam know what he was, unless he were obedient in some thing to his Lord

Swylce God ewǽde to him
as if God had said to him

Nast þu na þæt ic eom þin Hlaford and þæt þu eart min þeowa, buton þu do þæt ic þe háte, and forgáng þæt ic þe forbeode
Thou knowest not that I am thy Lord, and that thou art my servant, unless thou dost that which I command, and forgoest that which I forbid thee

Hwæt mæg hit þonne beon þæt þu forgán sceole
But what may it be that thou shalt forgo

ic ðe secge, forgang ðu anes treowes wæstm, and mid þære eaðelican gehyrsumnysse þu geearnast heofenan rices myrhðu and þone stede þe se deofol of-afeoll þurh ungehyrsumnesse
I say unto thee, forgo thou the fruit of one tree, and with that easy obedience thou shalt merit the joys of heaven, and the place from which the devil fell through disobedience

Gif ðu þonne ðis lytle bebód tobrecst, þu scealt deaðe sweltan
But if thou breakest this little commandment, thou shalt perish by death

And þa wæs Adam swa wís þæt God gelædde to him nytenu, and deorcynn, and fugelcynn, ðaða he hí gesceapene hæfde
And then was Adam so wise that God led to him the cattle, and brute race, and bird race, when he had created them

and Adam him eallum naman gesceop
and Adam made names for them all

and swa swa hé hí þa genamode swa hí sindon gyt gehatene
and so as he named them are they yet called

Þa cwæð God
Then said God

Nis na gedafenlic þæt þes man ana beo, and næbbe nænne fultum
It is not fitting that this man be alone, and have no help

ac uton gewyrcan him gemacan, him to fultume and to frofre
now let us make him a mate for help and comfort

And God þa geswefode þone Adam, and þaþa he slep ða genam he an rib of his sidan, and geworhte of ðam ribbe ænne wifman, and axode Adam hu heo hatan sceolde
And God then caused Adam to sleep, and as he slept, he took a rib from his side, and of that rib wrought a woman, and asked Adam how she should be called

Þa cwæð Adam
Then said Adam

Heo is ban of minum banum, and flæsc of minum flæsce
She is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh

beo hire nama Uirago, þæt is fæmne
be her name Virago, that is female

forðan ðe heo is of hire were genumen
because she is taken from her husband

Ða sette Adam eft hire oðerne naman, Aeua, þæt is lif
Then Adam afterwards bestowed on her another name, Eva, that is life

forðan ðe heo is ealra lybbendra modor
because she is the mother of all living

Ealle gesceafta, heofonas and englas, sunnan and monan, steorran and eorðan, ealle nytenu and fugelas, sǽ and ealle fixas, and ealle gesceafta God gesceop and geworhte on six dagum
All creatures, heavens and angels, sun and moon, stars and earth, all beasts and birds, the sea and all fishes, and all creatures, God created and wrought in six days

and on ðam seofoðan dæge hé geendode his weorc, and geswac ða and gehalgode þone seofoðan dæg, forðan ðe hé on ðam dæge his weorc geendode
and on the seventh day he ended his work, and ceased, and hallowed the seventh day, because on that day he ended his work

And he beheold þa ealle his weorc ðe he geworhte, and hí wæron ealle swiðe gode
And he beheld then all his works that he had wrought, and they were all exceedingly good

Ealle ðing he geworhte buton ælcum antimbre
All things he wrought without any matter

He cwæð
He said

Geweorðe leoht
Let there be light

and ðærrihte wæs leoht geworden
and instantly there was light

He cwæð eft
He said again

Geweorðe heofen
Let there be heaven

and þærrihte wæs heofen geworht, swa swa he mid his wisdome and mid his willan hit gedihte
and instantly heaven was made, as he with his wisdom and his will had appointed it

He cwæð eft, and het ða eorðan þæt heo sceolde forðlædan cuce nytenu, and hé ða gesceop of ðære eorðan eall nytencynn, and deorcynn, ealle ða ðe on feower fotum gað
He said again, and bade the earth bring forth all living cattle, and he then created of earth all the race of cattle, and the brute race, all those which go on four feet

ealswa eft of wætere he gesceop fixas and fugelas, and sealde ðam fixum sund, and ðam fugelum fliht
in like manner of water he created fishes and birds, and gave the power of swimming to the fishes, and flight to the birds

ac he ne sealde nanum nytene ne nanum fisce nane sawle
but he gave no soul to any beast, nor to any fish

ac heora blod is heora lif, and swa hraðe swa hi beoð deade, swa beoð hí mid ealle geendode
but their blood is their life, and as soon as they are dead they are totally ended

Þaða he worhte ðone mann Adám, he ne cwæð ná
When he had made the man Adam, he did not say

Geweorðe man geworht
Let man be made

ac he cwæð
but he said

Uton gewyrcan mannan to ure anlicnysse
Let us make man in our likeness

and hé worhte ða þone man mid his handum, and him on ableow sawle
and he then made man with his hands, and blew into him a soul

forði is se man betera, gif hé góde geðihð, þonne ealle ða nytenu sindon
therefore is man better, if he grow up in good, than all the beasts are

forðan ðe hí ealle gewurðað to nahte, and se man is ece on anum dæle, þæt is on ðære sawle
because they will all come to naught, and man is in one part eternal, that is in the soul

heo ne geendað næfre
that will never end

Se lichama is deadlic þurh Adames gylt, ac ðeah-hwæðere God arærð eft ðone lichaman to ecum ðingum on domes dæg
The body is mortal through Adam's sin, but, nevertheless, God will raise again the body to eternity on doomsday

Nu cwædon gedwolmen þæt deofol gesceope sume gesceafta, ac hí leogað
Now the heretics say that the devil created some creatures, but they lie

ne mæg hé nane gesceafta gescyppan, forðan ðe he nis na Scyppend, ac is atelic sceocca, and mid leasunge he wile beswican and fordón þone unwaran
he can create no creatures, for he is not a creator, but is a loathsome fiend, and with leasing he will deceive and fordo the unwary

ac he ne mæg nænne man to nanum leahtre geneadian, buton se mon his agenes willes to his lare gebuge
but he may not compel any man to any crime, unless the man voluntarily incline to his teaching

Swa hwæt swa is on gesceaftum wiðerweardlic geþuht and mannum derige, þæt is eall for urum synnum and yfelum geearnungum
Whatsoever among things created seems pernicious and is injurious to men, is all for our sins and evil deserts

Þa ongeat se deofol þæt Adam and Eua wæron to ðy gesceapene þæt hi sceolon mid eadmodnysse and mid gehyrsumnysse geearnian ða wununge on heofenan rice ðe hé of-afeoll for his up-ahefednysse, þa nam hé micelne graman and ándan to þam mannum, and smeade hú hé hí fordón mihte
When the devil understood that Adam and Eve were created, that they might with meekness and obedience merit the dwelling in the kingdom of heaven from which he had fallen for his haughtiness, then he felt great anger and envy towards those persons, and meditated how he might fordo them

He com ða on næddran hiwe to þam twam mannum, ærest to ðam wife, and hire to cwæð
He came then in a serpent's form to the two persons, first to the woman, and said to her

Hwí forbead God eow þæs treowes wæstm, ðe stent on middan neorxna-wange
Why has God forbidden you the fruit of this tree, which stands in the middle of Paradise

Þa cwæð þæt wíf
Then said the woman

God us forbead þæs treowes wæstm, and cwæð þæt we sceoldon deaðe sweltan, gif we his on byrigdon
God forbade us the fruit of the tree and said, that we should perish by death, if we tasted its fruit

Ða cwæð se deofol
Then said the devil

Nis hit na swa ðu segst, ac God wát genoh geare, gif ge of ðam treowe geetað, þonne beoð eowere eagan geopenode, and ge magon geseon and tocnáwan ægðer ge gód ge yfel, and ge beoð englum gelice
It is not as thou sayest, but God knows full well, if ye eat of that tree that your eyes will then be opened, and ye can see and know both good and evil, and ye will be like to angels

Næron hí blinde gesceapene, ac God hí gesceop swa bilewite þæt hí ne cuðon nan ðing yfeles, naðor ne on gesihðe, ne on spræce, ne on weorce
They were not created blind, but God created them so simple-minded that they knew nothing evil, neither by sight, nor by speech, nor by deed

Wearð þeah þæt wíf ða forspanen þurh ðæs deofles láre, and genam of ðæs treowes wæstme, and geæt, and sealde hire were, and hé geæt
But the woman was seduced by the devil's counsel, and took of the fruit of the tree, and ate, and gave to her consort, and he ate

Ða wæron hí butu deadlice, and cuðon ægðer ge gód ge yfel
Then they both became mortal, and knew both good and evil

and hí wæron ða nacode, and him ðæs sceamode
and they were naked, and thereat they were ashamed

Þa com God and axode hwi he his bebod tobræce
Then came God and asked why he had broken his commandment

and adræfde hí butu of neorxna-wange, and cwæð
and drove them both from Paradise, and said

Forðan ðe ðu wære gehyrsum ðines wifes wordum, and min bebod forsawe, þu scealt mid earfoðnyssum þe metes tilian, and seo eorðe þe is awyriged on þinum weorce, sylð þe ðornas and bremblas
Because thou wast obedient to the words of thy wife, and despisedst my commandment, thou shalt get thee food with hardships, and the earth, which is accursed through thy deed, shall give thee thorns and brambles

Þu eart of eorðan genumen, and þu awenst to eorðan
Thou art taken from earth, and thou shalt to earth return

Þu eart dust, and ðu awentst to duste
Thou art dust, and thou shalt turn to dust

God him worhte ða reaf of fellum, and hí wæron mid þam fellum gescrydde
God then wrought for them garments of skins, and they were clothed with the skins

Ða deadan fell getacnodon þæt hí wæron ða deadlice þe mihton beon undeadlice, gif hi heoldon þæt eaðelice Godes bebod
The dead skins betokened that they were then mortal who might have been immortal, if they had held that easy command of God

Ne þorfte Adam ne eal mancynn þe him siððan ofacom næfre deaðes onbyrian, gif þæt treow moste standan ungehrepod, and his nan man ne onbyrigde
Neither Adam nor all mankind that have since come from him needed ever to have tasted of death, if that tree could have stood untouched, and no one had tasted of it

ac sceolde Adam and his ofspring tyman on asettum tyman, swa swa nu doð clæne nytenu, and siððan ealle buton deaðe faran to ðan ecan life
but Adam and his offspring would have propagated at set times, as the clean beasts now do, and afterwards, without death, have gone to eternal life

Næs him gesceapen fram Gode, ne hé næs genedd þæt hé sceolde Godes bebod tobrecan
It was not ordained him from God, nor was he compelled to break God's commandment

ac God hine lét frigne, and sealde him agenne cyre, swa hé wære gehyrsum, swa hé wære ungehyrsum
for God left him free, and gave him his own choice, whether he would be obedient, or whether he would be disobedient

Hé wearð þa deofle gehyrsum, and Gode ungehyrsum, and wearð betæht, hé and eal mancynn, æfter ðisum lífe, into helle-wíte, mid þam deofle ðe hine forlærde
Then was he to the devil obedient, and to God disobedient, and was delivered, he and all mankind, after this life, to hell-torment, with the devil who seduced him

Þa wiste God hwæðere þæt hé wæs forlæred, and smeade hu he mihte his and ealles mancynnes eft gemiltsian
But God knew, however, that he had been seduced, and meditated how he might again be merciful to him and all mankind

On twam þingum hæfde God þæs mannes sawle gegodod
With two things had God endowed this man's soul

þæt is mid undeadlicnysse, and mid gesælðe
that is immortality and with happiness

Þa þurh deofles swicdom and Adames gylt we forluron þa gesælðe ure sawle, ac we ne forluron ná þa undeadlicnysse: heo is éce, and næfre ne geendað, þeah se lichama geendige, þe sceal eft þurh Godes mihte arisan to ecere wununge
Then through the devil's treachery and Adam's guilt we lost the happiness of our soul, but we lost not the immortality: that is eternal and never ends, though the body ends, which shall again, through God's might, arise to everlasting duration

Adam þa wæs wunigende on þisum life mid geswince, and hé and his wíf ða bearn gestryndon, ægðer ge suna ge dohtra
Adam then was continuing in this life with toil, and he and his wife begat children, both sons and daughters

and he leofode nigon hund geara and þrittig geara, and siððan swealt, swa swa him ær behaten wæs, for þan gylte
and he lived nine hundred and thirty years, and then died, as had been promised him for that sin

and his sawul gewende to helle
and his soul went to hell

Nu smeagiað sume men hwanon him come sawul
Now some men will inquire, whence came his soul

hwæþer ðe of þam fæder, þe of þære meder
whether from the father or from the mother

We cweðað of heora naðrum
We say, from neither of them

ac se ylca God þe gesceop Adam mid his handum, he gescypð ælces mannes lichaman on his modor innoðe: and se ylca seðe ableów on Adámes lichaman, and him forgeaf sawle, se ylca forgyfð cildum sawle and líf on heora modor innoðe, þonne hí gesceapene beoð
but the same God who created Adam with his hands, createth every man's body in his mother's womb: and the same who blew into Adam's body, and gave him a soul, that same giveth a soul and life to children in their mother's womb, when they are created

and he lætt hí habban agenne cyre, þonne hí geweaxene beoð, swa swa Adám hæfde
and he letteth them have their own will, when they are grown up, as Adam had

Þa wearð þa hrædlice micel mennisc geweaxen, and wæron swiðe manega on yfel awende, and gegremodon God mid mislicum leahtrum, and swiðost mid forligere
Then there was rapidly a great increase of people, and very many were turned to evil, and exasperated God with various crimes, and above all with fornication

Ða wearð God to þan swiðe gegremod þurh manna mándæda þæt he cwæð þæt him ofþuhte þæt hé æfre mancynn gesceop
Then was God so exasperated through the wicked deeds of men that he said, that he repented that he had ever created mankind

Ða wæs hwæþere án man rihtwis ætforan Gode, se wæs Nóe geháten
Nevertheless, there was one man righteous before God, who was called Noah

Þa cwæð God to him
Then said God to him

Ic wylle fordón eal mancynn mid wætere, for heora synnum, ac ic wylle gehealdan þe ænne, and þin wíf, and þine þry suna, Sem, and Cham, and Iafeth, and heora þreo wíf
I will destroy all mankind with water, for their sins, but I will preserve thee alone, and thy wife, and thy three sons, Shem, and Ham, and Japhet, and their three wives

forðan þe ðu eart rihtwis, and me gecweme
because thou art righteous and acceptable unto me

Wyrc þe nú ænne arc, þreo hund fæðma lang, and fiftig fæðma wíd, and þritig fæðma heah: gehref hit eall, and geclǽm ealle þa seamas mid tyrwan, and gá inn syððan mid þinum híwum
Make thee now an ark, three hundred fathoms long, and fifty fathoms wide, and thirty fathoms high: roof it all, and smear all the seams with tar, and then go in with thy family

Ic gegaderige in to þe of deorcynne, and of fugelcynne symble gemacan, þæt hí eft to fostre beon
I will gather in to thee of beast-kind and of bird-kind mates of each, that they may hereafter be for foster

Ic wille sendan flod ofer ealne middangeard
I will send a flood over all the earth

He dyde þa swa him God bebead, and God beleac hí bynnan þam arce, and asende rén of heofonum feowertig daga togædere, and geopenode þær togeanes ealle wyll-springas and wæter-þeotan of þære micclan niwelnysse
He did as God bade him, and God shut them within the ark, and sent rain from heaven forty days together, and opened, to meet it, all the well-springs and water-torrents of the great deep

Ðæt flod weox ða and abǽr up þone arc, and hit oferstah ealle dúna
The flood then waxed and bare up the ark, and it rose above all the hills

Wearð þa ælc þing cuces adrenct, buton þam ðe binnon þam arce wæron, of þam wearð eft ge-edstaðelod eall middangeard
Then was everything living drowned, save those who were within the ark, by whom was again established all the earth

Ða behét God þæt hé nolde næfre eft eal mancynn mid wætere acwellan, and cwæð to Noe and to his sunum
Then God promised that he would never again destroy all mankind with water, and said to Noah and to his sons

Ic wylle settan mín wedd betwux me and eow to þisum beháte: þæt is, þonne ic oferteo heofenas mid wólcnum, þonne bið æteowod min rénboga betwux þam wolcnum, þonne beo ic gemyndig mines weddes, þæt ic nelle heonon-forð mancynn mid wætere adrencan
I will set my covenant betwixt me and you for this promise: that is, when I overspread the heavens with clouds, then shall be shown my rainbow betwixt the clouds, then will I be mindful of my covenant, that I will not henceforth drown mankind with water

Noe leofode on eallum his life, ær þam flode and æfter þam flode, nigon hund geara and fiftig geara, and he þa forðferde
Noah lived in all his life, before the flood and after the flood, nine hundred and fifty years, and then he departed

Ða wæs þa sume hwíle Godes ege on mancynne æfter þam flode, and wæs án gereord on him eallum
Then for some time after the flood there was fear of God among mankind, and there was one language among them all

Ða cwædon hi betwux him þæt hi woldon wyrcan ane burh, and ænne stypel binnon þære byrig, swa heahne þæt his hrof astige up to heofenum: and begunnon þa to wyrcenne
Then said they among themselves that they would make a city, and a tower within that city, so high that its roof should mount up to heaven: and they begun to work

Ða com God þærto, þaða hí swiðost worhton, and sealde ælcum men þe ðær wæs synderlice spræce
Then came God thereto, when they were most busily working, and gave to every man who was there a separate speech

Þa wæron þær swa fela gereord swa ðær manna wæron, and heora nán nyste hwæt oðer cwæð
Then were there as many languages as there were men, and none of them knew what other said

And hí ða geswicon þære getimbrunge, and toferdon geond ealne middangeard
And they then ceased from the building, and went divers ways over all the earth

Ða siððan wearð mancynn þurh deofol beswicen, and gebiged fram Godes geleafan, swa þæt hí worhton him anlicnyssa, sume of golde, sume of seolfre, sume eac of stanum, sume of treowe, and sceopon him naman
Then afterwards mankind was deceived by the devil, and turned from God's belief, so that they wrought them images, some of gold, some of silver, some also of stones, some of wood, and devised names for them

þæra manna naman þe wæron entas and yfel-dæde
the names of those men who were giants, and evil-doing

Eft ðonne hí deade wæron, þonne cwædon þa cucan þæt hí wæron godas, and wurðodon hí, and him lác offrodon
Afterwards when they were dead then said the living that they were gods, and worshipped them, and offered sacrifices to them

and comon þa deoflu to heora anlicnyssum, and þæron wunodon, and to mannum spræcon swilce hí godas wæron
and the devils then came to their images, and dwelt therein, and spake to men as though they were gods

and þæt beswicene mennisc feoll on cneowum to þam anlicnyssum, and cwædon
and the deceived human race fell on their knees to those images, and said

Ge sind ure godas and we besettað urne geleafan and urne hiht on eow
Ye are our gods, and we place our belief and our hope in you

Ða asprang þis gedwyld geond ealne middangeard, and wæs se soða Scyppend, seðe ána is God, forsewen, and geunwurþod
Then sprang up this error through all the earth, and the true Creator, who alone is God, was despised and dishonoured

Ða wæs hwæðere an mægð þe næfre ne abeah to nanum deofolgylde, ac æfre wurðode þone soðan God
There was, nevertheless, one family which had never bent to any idol, but had ever worshipped the true God

Seo mægð aspráng of Nóes eltstan suna, se wæs gehaten Sem: he leofode six hund geara, and his sunu hatte Arfaxað, se leofode þreo hund geara and þreo and þrittig, and his sunu hatte Salé, se leofode feower hund geara and XXXIII þa gestrynde he sunu se wæs geháten Ebér, of þam aspráng þæt Ebreisce folc, þe God lufode: and of þam cynne comon ealle heahfæderas and witegan, þa ðe cyðdon Cristes to-cyme to þisum life
That family sprang from Noah's eldest son, who was called Shem: he lived six hundred years, and his son was called Arphaxad, who lived three hundred and thirty-three years, and his son was called Salah, who lived four hundred and thirty-three years, when he begat a son who was called Eber, from whom sprang the Hebrew people, whom God loved: and from that race came all the patriarchs and prophets, those who announced Christ's advent to this life

þæt hé wolde man beon, fornean on ende þyssere worulde, for ure alysednesse, seðe æfre wæs God mid þam healican Fæder
that he would be man before the end of this world, for our redemption, he who ever was God with the supreme Father

And þyssere mægðe God sealde and gesette ǽ, and hé hí lædde ofer sǽ mid drium fotum, and hé hí afedde feowertig wintra mid heofenlicum hlafe, and fela wundra on þam folce geworhte
And for this race God gave and established a law, and he led them over the sea with dry feet, and he fed them forty years with heavenly bread, and wrought many miracles among the people

forþan ðe he wolde of þyssere mægðe him modor geceosan
because he would choose him a mother from this race

Ða æt nextan, þa se tima com þe God foresceawode, þa asende he his engel Gabrihel to anum mædene of þam cynne, seo wæs María gehaten
Then at last, when the time came that God had foreseen, he sent his angel Gabriel to a maiden of that race, who was called Mary

Þa com se engel to hire, and hí gegrette mid Godes wordum, and cydde híre, þæt Godes Sunu sceolde beon acenned of hire, buton weres gemanan
Then came the angel to her, and greeted her with God's words, and announced to her, that God's Son should be born of her, without communion of man

And heo þa gelyfde his wordum, and wearð mid cilde
And she believed his words, and became with child

Ðaða hire tíma com heo acende, and þurhwunode mæden
When her time was come she brought forth, and continued a maiden

Ðæt cild is tuwa acenned: he is acenned of þam Fæder on heofonum, buton ælcere meder, and eft þaða hé man gewearð, þa wæs hé acenned of þam clænan mædene Marían, buton ælcum eorðlicum fæder
That child is twice born: he is born of the Father in heaven, without any mother, and again, when he became man, he was born of the pure virgin Mary, without any earthly father

God Fæder geworhte mancynn and ealle gesceafta þurh ðone Sunu
God the Father made mankind and all creatures through the Son

and eft, ðaða we forwyrhte wæron, þa asende hé ðone ylcan Sunu to úre alysednesse
and again, when we were fordone, he sent that same Son for our redemption

Seo halige moder María þa afedde þæt cild mid micelre arwurðnesse, and hit weox swa swa oðre cild doð, buton synne anum
The holy mother Mary then nourished that child with great veneration, and it waxed, as other children do, without any sin

He wæs buton synnum acenned, and his líf wæs eal buton synnum
He was born without sins, and his life was all without sins

Ne worhte he þeah náne wúndra openlice ǽrðan ðe hé wæs þritig wintre on þære menniscnysse: þa siðþan geceas he him leorning-cnihtas
But he wrought no miracles openly ere that he had been thirty years in a state of man: then afterwards he chose to him disciples

ærest twelf, þa we hátað apostolas, þæt sind ærendracan: Siþþan hé geceas twá and hund-seofontig, þa sind genemnede discipuli, þæt sind leorning-cnihtas
first twelve, whom we call apostles, that is messengers: after that he chose seventy-two, who are denominated disciples, that is learners

Ða worhte hé fela wundra, þæt men mihton gelyfan þæt he wæs Godes Bearn
Then he wrought many miracles, that men might believe that he was God's Child

Hé awende wæter to wine, and eode ofer sǽ mid drium fotum, and he gestilde windas mid his hæse, and hé forgeaf blindum mannum gesihðe, and healtum and lamum rihtne gáng, and hreoflium smeðnysse, and hælu heora lichaman
He turned water to wine, and went over the sea with dry feet, and he stilled the winds by his behest, and he gave to blind men sight, and to the halt and lame a right gait, and to lepers smoothness and health to their bodies

dumbum hé forgeaf getingnysse, and deafum heorcnunge
to the dumb he gave power of speech, and hearing to the deaf

deofolseocum and wodum hé sealde gewitt, and þa deoflu todræfde, and ælce untrumnysse he gehælde
to the possessed of devils and the mad he gave sense, and drove away the devils, and every disease he healed

deade men hé arærde of heora byrgenum to lífe
dead men he raised from their sepulchres to life

and lærde þæt folc þe hé to com mid micclum wisdome
and taught the people to which he came with great wisdom

and cwæð þæt nán man ne mæg beon gehealden, buton he rihtlice on God gelyfe, and he beo gefullod, and his geleafan mid godum weorcum geglenge
and said, that no man might be saved, except he rightly believe in God, and be baptized, and adorn his faith with good works

he onscunode ælc unriht and ealle leasunga, and tæhte rihtwisnysse and soðfæstnysse
he eschewed all injustice and all leasings, and taught righteousness and truth

Þa nam þæt Iudeisce folc micelne ándan ongean his láre, and smeadon hú hí mihton híne to deaðe gedón
Then the Jewish people showed great envy of his doctrine, and meditated how they might put him to death

Þa wearð án ðæra twelfa Cristes geferena, se wæs Iudas gehaten, þurh deofles tihtinge beswicen, and hé eode to þam Iudeiscum folce, and smeade wið hí, hu he Crist him belǽwan mihte
Now was one of the twelve of Christ's companions, who was called Judas, seduced by the instigation of the devil, and he went to the Jewish people, and consulted with them how he might betray Christ unto them

Þeah ðe eal mennisc wǽre gegaderod, ne mihton hí ealle hine acwellan, gif he sylf nolde
Though all people were gathered together they all might not destroy him, if he himself willed it not

forði he cóm to us þæt hé wolde for ús deað þrowian, and swa eal mancynn þa ðe gelyfað mid his agenum deaðe alysan fram helle-wite
therefore he came to us because he would suffer death for us, and so, by his own death, redeem all mankind who believe from hell's torment

Hé nolde geniman ús neadunge of deofles anwealde, buton he hit forwyrhte
He would not take us forcibly from the devil's power, unless he had forfeited it

þa hé hit forwyrhte genóh swiðe, þaða hé gehwette and tihte ðæra Iudeiscra manna heortan to Cristes slege
but he forfeited it entirely when he whetted and instigated the hearts of the Jewish men to the slaying of Christ

Crist ða geðafode þæt ða wælhreowan hine genámon and gebundon, and on róde hengene acwealdon
Then Christ consented that the bloodthirsty ones should take him, and bind, and, hung on a cross, slay him

Hwæt ða twegen gelyfede men hine arwurðlice bebyrigdon, and Crist on ðære hwile to helle gewende, and þone deofol gewylde, and him of-anám Adám and Euan, and heora ofspring, þone dǽl ðe him ǽr gecwemde, and gelædde hí to heora lichaman, and arás of deaðe mid þam micclum werede on þam þriddan dæge his þrowunge: Cóm þa to his apostolum, and hí gefrefrode, and geond feowertigra daga fyrst him mid wunode: and ða ylcan lare þe hé him ǽr tæhte eft ge-edlæhte, and het hí faran geond ealne middangeard, bodigende fulluht and soðne geleafan
Verily then two believing men honourably buried him, and Christ, in that time, went to hell, and overcame the devil, and took from him Adam and Eve, and their offspring, that portion which had previously been most acceptable to him, and led them to their bodies, and arose from death with that great host on the third day of his passion: then came to his apostles, and comforted them, and for a space of forty days sojourned with them, and repeated the same doctrine which he had before taught them, and bade them go over all the earth, preaching baptism and true faith

Drihten ða on ðam feowerteogoðan dæge his æristes astah to heofenum, ætforan heora ealra gesihðe, mid þam ylcan lichaman þe hé on þrowode, and sitt on ða swiðran his Fæder, and ealra gesceafta gewylt
Then, on the fortieth day of his resurrection, the Lord ascended to heaven in sight of them all, with the same body in which he had suffered, and sitteth on the right hand of his Father, and governeth all creatures

Hé hæfð gerymed rihtwisum mannum infær to his rice, and ða ðe his beboda eallunga forseoð beoð on helle besencte
He hath opened to righteous men the entrance to his kingdom, and those who wholly despise his commandments shall be cast down into hell

Witodlice hé cymð on ende þyssere worulde mid micclum mægenþrymme on wolcnum, and ealle ða ðe æfre sawle underfengon arisað of deaðe him togeanes
Verily he shall come at the end of this world with great majesty, in clouds, and all those who have ever received a soul shall arise from death towards him

and hé ðonne ða mánfullan deofle betæcð into ðam ecan fyre helle susle
and he will then deliver the wicked to the devil, into the eternal fire of hell-torment

þa rihtwisan he læt mid him into heofonan rice, on þam hí rixiað á on ecnysse
the righteous he will lead with him into the kingdom of heaven, in which they shall rule to all eternity

Men most beloved, consider this discourse, and with great care eschew unrighteousness, and merit with good works the eternal life with God, who alone ruleth to eternity

Amen
Amen

We will, for the confirmation of your faith, relate to you the nativity of our Saviour, according to the order of the gospel: how he on this present day was born in true humanity in divine nature

Lucas se Godspellere awrát on Cristes béc, þæt on ðam timan se Romanisca casere Octauianus sette gebánn, þæt wære on gewritum asett eall ymbhwyrft
Luke the Evangelist wrote in the book of Christ, that at that time the Roman emperor Octavianus made proclamation that all the world should be set down in writing

Þeos towritennys wearð aræred fram ðam ealdormen Cyrino, of Sirian lande, þæt ælc man ofer-heafod sceolde cennan his gebyrde, and his áre on ðære byrig þe hé to gehyrde
This enrolment was set forth from Cyrenius, the governor of Syria—that every man in general should declare his birth and his possession in the city to which he belonged

Þa ferde Ioseph, Cristes foster-fæder, fram Galileiscum earde, of ðære byrig Nazareð, to Iudeiscre byrig, seo wæs Dauides, and wæs geciged Bethleém, forðan ðe hé wæs of Dauides mægðe, and wolde andettan mid Marían hire gebyrde, þe wæs þa gýt bearn-eaca
Then Joseph, the foster-father of Christ, went from the land of Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to the Jewish city, which was of David, and was called Bethlehem, because he was of the tribe of David, and would acknowledge with Mary her birth, who was then great with child

Ða gelámp hit, þaða hí on þære byrig Bethleém wícodon, þæt hire tima wæs gefylled þæt heo cennan sceolde, and acende ða hyre frumcennedan sunu, and mid cild-claðum bewánd, and aléde þæt cild on heora assena binne, forþan þe ðær næs nán rymet on þam gesthuse
Then it came to pass, while they were sojourning in the city of Bethlehem, that her time was fulfilled that she should bring forth, and she brought forth then her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid the child in their asses' bin, because there was no room in the inn

Þa wæron hyrdas on þam earde waciende ofer heora eowede
And there were shepherds in the country watching over their flock

and efne ða Godes engel stód on emn hí, and Godes beorhtnys hí bescean, and hí wurdon micclum afyrhte
and lo, the angel of God stood before them, and God's brightness shone on them, and they were much afraid

Ða cwæð se Godes engel to ðam hyrdum
Then said the angel of God to the shepherds

Ne ondredað eow, efne ic eow bodige micelne gefean, þe becymð eallum folce
Fear not, lo, I announce to you great joy, which shall come to all people

forðan þe nu to-dæg is eow acenned Hælend Crist on Dauides ceastre
for now to-day is born to you a Saviour, Christ, in the city of David

Ge geseoð þis tácen, ge gemétað þæt cild mid cild-claðum bewunden, and on binne geléd
Ye shall see this token, ye shall find the child wrapped in swaddling clothes, and laid in a bin

Þa færlice, æfter þæs engles spræce, wearð gesewen micel menigu heofenlices werodes God herigendra and singendra
Then suddenly, after the angel's speech, there was seen a great multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and singing

Gloria in excelsis Deo, et in terra pax hominibus bone uoluntatis
Gloria in excelsis Deo, et in terra pax hominibus bonæ voluntatis

þæt is on urum gereorde
that is in our tongue

Sy wuldor Gode on heannyssum, and on eorðan sibb mannum, þam ðe beoð godes willan
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men who are of good will

And ða englas ða gewiton of heora gesihðe to heofonum
And the angels then withdrew from their sight to heaven

Hwæt ða hyrdas þa him betweonan spræcon
The shepherds then spake among themselves

Uton faran to Bethleem, and geseon þæt word þe us God æteowde
Let us go to Bethlehem, and see the word that God hath manifested unto us

Hí comon ða hrædlice, and gemetton Marían, and Ioseph, and þæt cild geled on anre binne, swa swa him se engel cydde
They came then quickly, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the child laid in a bin, as the angel had announced to them

Þa hyrdas soðlice oncneowon be þam worde þe him gesæd wæs be ðam cilde, and ealle wundrodon þe þæt gehyrdon, and eac be ðam ðe þa hyrdas him sǽdon
But the shepherds understood the word that had been said to them concerning the child, and all wondered that heard it, and also at that which the shepherds said unto them

María soðlice heold ealle þas wórd arǽfniende on hire heortan
But Mary held all these words, pondering them in her heart

Ða gecyrdon þa hyrdas ongean wuldrigende and herigende God on eallum ðam ðingum þe hí gehyrdon and gesawon, swa swa him fram þam engle gesǽd wæs
Then the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen, as had been said to them by the angel

Mine gebroðra þa leofostan, ure Hælend, Godes Sunu, euen-ece and gelic his Fæder, seðe mid him wæs æfre buton anginne, gemedemode hine sylfne þæt he wolde on ðisum dægðerlicum dæge, for middangeardes alysednysse beon lichamlice acenned of þam mædene Marían
My dearest brethren, our Saviour, the Son of God, co-eternal with, and equal to his Father, who was ever with him without beginning, vouchsafed that he would on this present day, for the redemption of the world, be corporally born of the Virgin Mary

He is Ealdor and Scyppend ealra gódnyssa and sibbe, and he foresende his acennednysse ungewunelice sibbe, forðan ðe næfre næs swilc sibb ær þam fyrste on middangearde, swilc swa wæs on his gebyrde-tide
He is Prince and Author of all things good and of peace, and he sent before his birth unwonted peace, for never was there such peace before that period in the world, as there was at the time of his birth

swa þæt eall middangeard wæs anes mannes rice underðeod, and eal mennisc him anum cynelic gafol ageaf
so that all the world was subjected to the empire of one man, and all mankind paid royal tribute to him alone

Witodlice on swa micelre sibbe wæs Crist acenned, seðe is ure sib, forþan ðe hé geþeodde englas and men to ánum hirede, þurh his menniscnysse
Verily in such great peace was Christ born, who is our peace, because he united angels and men to one family through his incarnation

Hé wæs acenned on þæs caseres dagum þe wæs Octauianus geháten, se gerymde Romana rice to ðan swiðe þæt him eal middangeard to beah, and he wæs forði Augustus geciged, þæt is geýcende his rice
He was born in the days of the emperor who was called Octavianus, who extended the Roman empire to that degree that all the world bowed to him, and he was, therefore, named Augustus, that is, Increasing his empire

Se nama gedafenað þam heofonlican Cyninge Criste, þe on his timan acenned wæs, seðe his heofonlice rice geyhte, and ðone hryre, þe se feallenda deofol on engla werode gewanode, mid menniscum gecynde eft gefylde
The name befits the heavenly King Christ, who was born in his time, who increased his heavenly empire, and replenished with mankind the loss which the falling devil had caused in the host of angels

Na þæt án þæt he ðone lyre anfealdlice gefylde, ac eac swylce micclum geihte
Not only did he simply supply its loss, but also greatly increased it

Soðlice swa micel getel mancynnes becymð þurh Cristes menniscnysse to engla werodum, swa micel swa on heofonum beláf haligra engla æfter ðæs deofles hryre
Verily as great a number of mankind cometh, through Christ's incarnation, to the hosts of angels, as there remained of holy angels in heaven after the devil's fall

Þæs caseres gebann, þe het ealne middangeard awritan, getacnode swutellice þæs heofonlican Cyninges dæde, þe to ði com on middangeard þæt he of eallum ðeodum his gecorenan gegaderode, and heora naman on ecere eadignysse awrite
The emperor's decree, which commanded all the world to be inscribed, betokened manifestly the deed of the heavenly King, who came into the world that he might gather his chosen from all nations, and write their names in everlasting bliss

Þeos towritennys asprang fram ðam ealdormen Cyrino: Cyrinus is gereht Yrfenuma, and he getacnode Crist, seðe is soð yrfenuma þæs ecan Fæder
This decree sprang from the governor Cyrenius—Cyrenius is interpreted Heir, and he betokened Christ, who is the true heir of the eternal Father

and he us forgifð þæt we mid him beon yrfenuman and efenhlyttan his wuldres
and he granteth us to be heirs with him, and partakers of his glory

Ealle ðeoda þa ferdon þæt ælc synderlice be him sylfum cennan sceolde, on ðære byrig þe he to hyrde
All nations then went that each separately might declare concerning himself, in the city to which he belonged

Swa swa on ðam timan be ðæs caseres gebanne gehwilce ænlipige on heora burgum be him sylfum cendon, swa eac nu us cyðað láreowas Cristes gebann, þæt we ús gegadrian to his halgan gelaðunge, and on ðære ures geleafan gafol mid estfullum mode him agifan, þæt ure naman beon awritene on lifes bec mid his gecorenum
As at that time, according to the emperor's proclamation, each one singly, in their cities, declared concerning himself, so also now do our teachers make known to us Christ's proclamation, that we gather us to his holy congregation, and therein, with devout mind, pay to him the tribute of our faith, that our names may be written in the book of life with his chosen

Drihten wæs acenned on þære byrig ðe is gehaten Bethleem, forðan ðe hit wæs swa ǽr gewitegod þisum wordum
The Lord was born in the city which is named Bethlehem, because it was so before prophesied in these words

Þu Bethleem, Iudeisc land, ne eart ðu wacost burga on Iudeiscum ealdrum: soðlice of ðe cymð se latteow þe gewylt Israhela ðeoda
Thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, thou art not meanest of cities among the Jewish princes, for of thee shall come the guide that shall govern the people of Israel

Crist wolde on ytinge beon acenned, to ði þæt he wurde his ehterum bedigelod
Christ would be born on journey, that he might be concealed from his persecutors

Bethleem is gereht 'Hlaf-hús,' and on hire wæs Crist, se soða hlaf, acenned, þe be him sylfum cwæð
Bethlehem is interpreted Bread house, and in it was Christ, the true bread, brought forth, who saith of himself

Ic eom se liflica hláf, þe of heofenum astáh, and seðe of ðam hlafe geett ne swylt hé on ecnysse
I am the vital bread, which descended from heaven, and he who eateth of this bread shall not die to eternity

Þæs hlafes we onbyriað þonne we mid geleafan to husle gað
This holy bread we taste when we with faith go to housel

forðan þe þæt halige husel is gastlice Cristes lichama
because the holy housel is spiritually Christ's body

and þurh ðone we beoð alysede fram ðam ecan deaðe
and through that we are redeemed from eternal death

María acende ða hire frumcennedan sunu on ðisum andweardan dæge, and hine mid cild-claðum bewánd, and for rymetleaste on anre binne geléde
Mary brought forth her firstborn son on this present day, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and, for want of room, laid him in a bin

Næs þæt cild forði gecweden hire frumcennede cild swilce heo oðer siððan acende, ac forði þe Crist is frumcenned of manegum gastlicum gebroðrum
That child is not called her firstborn child because she afterwards brought forth another, but because Christ is the firstborn of many spiritual brothers

Ealle cristene men sind his gastlican gebroðra, and hé is se frumcenneda, on gife and on godcundnysse ancenned of ðam Ælmihtigan Fæder
All christian men are his spiritual brothers, and he is the firstborn, in grace and in godliness only-begotten of the Almighty Father

Hé wæs mid wacum cild-claðum bewæfed, þæt he ús forgeafe ða undeadlican tunecan, þe we forluron on ðæs frumsceapenan mannes forgægednysse
He was wrapped in mean swaddling clothes, that he might give us the immortal garment which we lost by the first created man's transgression

Se Ælmihtiga Godes Sunu, ðe heofenas befon ne mihton, wæs geled on nearuwre binne, to ði þæt he ús fram hellicum nyrwette alysde
The Almighty Son of God, whom the heavens could not contain, was laid in a narrow bin, that he might redeem us from the narrowness of hell

María wæs ða cuma ðær, swa swa þæt godspel ús segð
Mary was there a stranger, as the gospel tells us

and for ðæs folces geðryle wæs þæt gesthus ðearle genyrwed
and through the concourse of people the inn was greatly crowded

Se Godes Sunu wæs on his gesthuse genyrwed, þæt he us rume wununge on heofonan rice forgife, gif we his willan gehyrsumiað
The Son of God was crowded in his inn, that he might give us a spacious dwelling in the kingdom of heaven, if we obey his will

Ne bitt hé us nánes ðinges to edleane his geswinces, buton ure sawle hælo, þæt we ús sylfe clæne and ungewemmede him gegearcian, to blisse and to ecere myrhðe
He asks nothing of us as reward for his toil, except our soul's health, that we may prepare ourselves for him pure and uncorrupted in bliss and everlasting joy

Þa hyrdas ðe wacodon ofer heora eowode on Cristes acennednysse, getacnodon ða halgan lareowas on Godes gelaðunge, þe sind gastlice hyrdas geleaffulra sawla: and se engel cydde Cristes acennednysse hyrdemannum, forðam ðe ðan gastlicum hyrdum, þæt sind lareowas, is swiðost geopenod embe Cristes menniscnysse, þurh boclice lare
The shepherds that watched over their flock at Christ's birth, betokened the holy teachers in God's church, who are the spiritual shepherds of faithful souls: and the angel announced Christ's birth to the herdsmen, because to the spiritual shepherds, that is, teachers, is chiefly revealed concerning Christ's humanity, through book-learning: and they shall sedulously preach to those placed under them, that which is manifested to them, as the shepherds proclaimed the heavenly vision

and hí sceolon gecneordlice heora underþeoddum bodian, þæt þæt him geswutelod is, swa swa ða hyrdas þa heofenlican gesihðe gewídmærsodan
It beseemeth the teacher to be ever watchful over God's flock, that the invisible wolf scatter not the sheep

Gelóme wurdon englas mannum æteowode on ðære ealdan ǽ, ac hit nis awriten þæt hí mid leohte comon, ac se wurðmynt wæs þises dæges mærðe gehealden, þæt hí mid heofenlicum leohte hí geswutelodon, ðaða þæt soðe leoht aspráng on ðeostrum riht geþancodum, se mildheorta and se rihtwisa Drihten
Oftentimes, in the ancient law, angels appeared to men, but it is not written that they came with light, for that honour was reserved for the greatness of this day, that they should manifest themselves with heavenly light, when that true light sprang up in darkness to the right thinkers, the merciful and righteous Lord

Se engel cwæð to þam hyrdum
The angel said to the shepherds

Ne beo ge afyrhte, efne ic bodige eow micelne gefean, ðe eallum folce becymð, forðan þe nu to-dæg is acenned Hælend Crist on Dauides ceastre
Be ye not afraid, lo, I announce to you great joy, which shall come to all people, for to-day is born a Saviour Christ in the city of David

Soðlice hé bodade micelne gefean, seðe næfre ne geendað
Verily he announced great joy, which shall never end

forðan þe Cristes acennednys gegladode heofenwara, and eorðwara, and helwara
for Christ's nativity gladdened the inhabitants of heaven, and of earth, and of hell

Se engel cwæð
The angel said

Nu to-dæg is eow acenned Hælend Crist on Dauides ceastre
Now to-day is born to you a Saviour Christ, in the city of David

Rihtlice hé cwæð on dæge, and ná on nihte, forðan ðe Crist is se soða dæg, seðe todræfde mid his to-cyme ealle nytennysse þære ealdan nihte, and ealne middangeard mid his gife onlihte
rightly he said to-day, and not to-night, for Christ is the true day who scattered with his advent all the ignorance of the ancient night, and illumined all the world with his grace

Þæt tácen þe se engel ðam hyrdum sæde we sceolon symle on urum gemynde healdan, and þancian ðam Hælende þæt he gemedemode hine sylfne to ðan þæt hé dælnimend wære ure deadlicnysse, mid menniscum flæsce befangen, and mid wáclicum cild-claðum bewunden
The sign which the angel said to the shepherds we ought ever to hold in our remembrance, and to thank the Saviour that he so humbled himself that he was the partaker of our mortality, with human flesh invested, and wrapt in mean swaddling clothes

Þa fǽrlice, æfter þæs engles spræce, wearð gesewen micel menigu heofenlices werodes God herigendra and singendra
Then suddenly, after the angel's speech, was seen a great multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and singing

Sy wuldor Gode on heannyssum, and on eorðan sibb þam mannum þe beoð godes willan
Be glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men who are of good will

An engel bodade þam hyrdum þæs heofonlican Cyninges acennednysse, and ða færlice wurdon æteowode fela ðusend engla, þy læs ðe wǽre geþuht anes engles ealdordom to hwonlic to swa micelre bodunge: and hí ealle samod mid gedremum sange Godes wuldor hleoðrodon, and godum mannum sibbe bodedon, swutellice æteowiende þæt þurh his acennednysse men beoð gebigede to anes geleafan sibbe, and to wuldre godcundlicere herunge
An angel announced to the shepherds the heavenly King's nativity, and suddenly appeared many thousand angels, lest the preeminence of one angel should seem too inadequate for so great an announcement: and they all together, with melodious song, God's glory celebrated, and to good men announced peace, manifestly showing that through his birth men shall be inclined to the peace of one faith, and to the glory of divine praise

Hí sungon
They sung

Sy wuldor Gode on heannyssum, and on eorðan sibb mannum, ðam ðe beoð godes willan
Be glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men, to those who are of good will

Ðas word geswuteliað þæt ðær wunað Godes sibb þær se goda willa bið
These words manifest that where the peace of God dwelleth, there is good will

Eornostlice mancynn hæfde ungeþwærnysse to englum ær Drihtnes acennednysse
But mankind had discord with angels before the Lord's nativity

forðan ðe we wæron þurh synna ælfremede fram Gode
because we were through sins estranged from God

þa wurde we eac ælfremede fram his englum getealde: ac siððan se heofenlica Cyning urne eorðlican lichaman underfeng, siððan gecyrdon his englas to ure sibbe
then were we accounted estranged also from his angels: but after that the heavenly King assumed our earthly body, his angels turned to peace with us

and ða ðe hí ærðan untrume forsawon, þa hi wurðiað nu him to geferum
and those whom they had before despised as mean they now honour as their companions

Witodlice on ðære ealdan ǽ, Loð, and Iosue, and gehwilce oðre þe englas gesawon, hí luton wið heora, and to him gebædon, and ða englas þæt geðafodon: ac Iohannes se Godspellere, on ðære Niwan Gecyðnysse, wolde hine gebiddan to þam engle þe him to spræc, þa forwyrnde se engel him ðæs, and cwæð
But in the ancient law, Lot, and Joshua, and certain others who saw angels, bowed before them, and prayed to them, and the angels allowed it: but when John the Evangelist, in the New Testament, would pray to the angel who spake to him, the angel forbade him, and said

Beheald þæt ðu ðas dæde ne dó
See that thou do not this deed

ic eom ðin efen-ðeowa, and ðinra gebroðra
I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren: pray to God only

Englas geþafodon ær Drihtnes to-cyme þæt mennisce men him to feollon, and æfter his to-cyme þæs forwyrndon, forðan þe hí gesáwon þæt heora Scyppend þæt gecynd underfeng þe hí ær ðan wáclic tealdon, and ne dorston hit forseon on ús, þonne hí hit wurðiað bufon him sylfum on ðam heofonlican Cyninge
because they saw that their Creator had assumed that nature which they had before accounted mean, and durst not despise it in us, when they honour it above themselves in the heavenly King

Ne hí manna geferrædene ne forhógiað, þonne hí feallende hí to þam menniscum Gode gebiddað
Nor despise they the fellowship of men, when falling down they pray to the human God

Nu we sind getealde Godes ceaster-gewaran, and englum gelíce
Now we are accounted citizens of God, and like to angels

uton forði hógian þæt leahtras us ne totwæmon fram ðisum micclum wurðmynte
let us, therefore, take care that sins do not separate us from this great dignity

Soðlice men syndon godas gecigede
Verily men are called gods

heald forði, ðu mann, þinne godes wurðscipe wið leahtras
preserve, therefore, thou man, thy dignity of a god against sins, since God became man for thee

Þa hyrdas ða spræcon him betweonan, æfter ðæra engla fram-færelde
The shepherds then spake among themselves, after the departure of the angels

Uton gefaran to Bethleém, and geseon þæt word þe geworden is, and God us geswutelode
Let us go to Bethlehem, and see the word which is come to pass, and that God hath revealed unto us

Eala hú rihtlice hí andetton þone halgan geleafan mid þisum wordum
O how rightly they acknowledged the holy faith with these words

On frymðe wæs wórd, and þæt word wæs mid Gode, and þæt wórd wæs God
In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and that word was God

Word bið wisdomes geswutelung, and þæt Word, þæt is se Wisdom, is acenned of ðam Ælmihtigum Fæder, butan anginne
A word is the manifestation of wisdom, and the Word, that is Wisdom, is begotten of the Almighty Father, without beginning

forðan ðe hé wæs æfre God of Gode, Wisdom of ðam wisan Fæder
for he was ever God of God, Wisdom of the wise Father

Nis hé na geworht, forðan ðe he is God, and na gesceaft
He is not made, for he is God, and not a creature

ac se Ælmihtiga Fæder gesceop þurh ðone Wisdom ealle gesceafta, and hi ealle ðurh þone Halgan Gast gelíffæste
for the Almighty Father created all creatures through that Wisdom, and endowed them all with life through the Holy Ghost

Ne mihte ure mennisce gecynd Crist on ðære godcundlican acennednysse geseon
Our human nature could not see Christ in that divine nativity

ac þæt ylce Word wæs geworden flæsc, and wunode on ús, þæt we hine geseon mihton
but that same Word became flesh and dwelt in us, that we might see him

Næs þæt Word to flæsce awend, ac hit wæs mid menniscum flæsce befangen
The Word was not turned to flesh, but it was invested with human flesh

Swa swa anra gehwilc manna wunað on sawle and on lichaman án mann, swa eac Crist wunað on godcundnysse and menniscnysse, on ánum hade án Crist
As every man existeth in soul and in body one man, so also Christ existeth in divine nature and human nature, in one person one Christ

Hí cwædon
They said

Uton geseon þæt word þe geworden is
Let us see the word that is come to pass

forðan ðe hí ne mihton hit geseon ær ðan ðe hit geflæschamod wæs, and to menn geworden
because they could not see it before it was incarnate, and become man

Nis þeahhwæðre seo godcundnys gemenged to ðære menniscnysse, ne ðær nan twæming nys
Nevertheless, the divine nature is not mingled with the human nature, nor is there any separation

We mihton eow secgan ane lytle bysne, gif hit to wáclic nære
We might tell unto you a little simile, if it were not too mean

Sceawa nú on anum æge, hú þæt hwite ne bið gemenged to ðam geolcan, and bið hwæðere án æg
Look now on an egg, how the white is not mingled with the yolk, and yet it is one egg

Nis eac Cristes godcundnys gerunnen to ðære menniscnysse, ac he þurhwunað þeah á on ecnysse on anum hade untotwæmed
Nor also is Christ's divinity confounded with human nature, but he continueth to all eternity in one person undivided

Hrædlice ða comon þa hyrdas and gemetton Marian and Ioseph, and þæt cild geléd on ðære binne
Then came the shepherds quickly, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the child laid in the bin

Maria wæs be Godes dihte þam rihtwisan Iosepe beweddod, for micclum gebeorge
Mary was, by God's direction, betrothed to the righteous Joseph, for the greater security

forðan ðe hit wæs swa gewunelic on Iudeiscre ðeode, æfter Moyses ǽ, þæt gif ænig wimman cild hæfde butan be rihtre æwe, þæt hí man sceolde mid stanum oftorfian
because it was thus customary among the Jewish people, according to the law of Moses, that if any woman had a child, save in lawful wedlock, she should be slain with stones

Ac God asende his engel to Iosepe, ða María eacnigende wæs, and bead þæt he hire gymene hæfde, and þæs cildes foster-fæder wære
But God sent his angel to Joseph, when Mary was pregnant, and commanded that he should have care of her, and be the child's foster-father

Þa wæs geðuht ðam Iudeiscum swilce Ioseph þæs cildes fæder wære, ac hé næs
Then it seemed to the Jews that Joseph was father of the child, but he was not

forðan þe hit næs nan neod þam Ælmihtigum Scyppende þæt hé of wífe acenned wære
because the Almighty Creator had no need to be born of woman

ac hé genam ða menniscnysse of Marían innoðe, and forlet hí mæden na gewemmed, ac gehalgod þurh his acennednysse
but he took human nature from the womb of Mary, and left her a virgin undefiled, but hallowed through his birth

Ne oncneow heo weres gemanan, and heo acende butan sare, and þurhwunað on mægðhade
She knew no society of man, and she brought forth without pain, and continued in maidenhood

Þa hyrdas gesawon, and oncneowon be ðam cilde, swa swa him gesǽd wæs
The shepherds saw and recognized the child, as had to them been told

Nis nan eadignys butan Godes oncnawennesse, swa swa Crist sylf cwæð ðaða he us his Fæder betæhte
(There is no happiness without knowledge of God, as Christ himself said, when he committed us to his Father

Þæt is ece líf, þæt hi ðe oncnawon soðne God, and ðone ðe þu asendest Hælend Crist
That is eternal life that they acknowledge Thee, the true God, and him whom thou hast sent, the Saviour Christ

Hwæt ða ealle ða ðe þæt gehyrdon micclum ðæs wundrodon, and be ðam ðe ða hyrdas sædon
) Now all who heard that wondered greatly thereat, and at what the shepherds said

María soðlice heold ealle ðas wórd aræfniende on hire heortan
But Mary held all these words, pondering them in her heart

Heo nolde widmærsian Cristes digelnesse, ac anbidode oð þæt he sylf þaða he wolde hí geopenode
She would not publish Christ's mystery, but waited until he himself, when it pleased him, should divulge it

Heo cuðe Godes ǽ, and on ðæra witegena gesetnysse rædde, þæt mæden sceolde God acennan
She knew God's law, and in the book of the prophets had read, that a virgin should give birth to God

Þa blissode heo micclum þæt heo hit beon moste
Then she greatly rejoiced that she might be it

Hit wæs gewitegod þæt hé on ðære byrig Bethleem acenned wurde, and heo ðearle wundrode þæt heo æfter ðære witegunge ðær acende
It was prophesied that he should be born in the city of Bethlehem, and she greatly wondered that, according to that prophecy, she was there delivered

Heo gemunde hwæt sum witega cwæð
She remembered that a prophet had said

Se oxa oncneow his hlaford, and se assa his hlafordes binne
The ox knows his master, and the ass his master's bin

Þa geseah heo þæt cild licgan on binne, ðær se oxa and se assa gewunelice fodan secað
Then saw she the child lying in the bin, where the ox and the ass usually seek food

Godes heah-engel Gabrihel bodode Marían ðæs Hælendes to-cyme on hire innoðe, and heo geseah ða þæt his bodung unleaslice gefylled wæs
God's archangel Gabriel had announced to Mary the Saviour's coming into her womb, and she then saw that his announcement was truly fulfilled

Ðyllice word María heold aræfnigende on hire heortan
Such words Mary held, pondering them in her heart

And þa hyrdas gecyrdon ongean wuldrigende and herigende God, on eallum ðam ðingum ðe hí gehyrdon and gesáwon, swa swa him gesæd wæs
And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all those things which they had heard and seen, as had been told unto them

Þyssera ðreora hyrda gemynd is gehæfd be eastan Bethleem áne mile, on Godes cyrcan geswutelod, þam ðe ða stowe geneosiað
The memory of these three shepherds is preserved one mile to the east of Bethlehem, and manifested in God's church to those who visit the place

We sceolon geefenlæcan þysum hyrdum, and wuldrian and hérian urne Drihten on eallum ðam ðingum þe he for ure lufe gefremode, ús to alysednysse and to ecere blisse, ðam sy wuldor and lof mid ðam Ælmihtigum Fæder, on annysse þæs Halgan Gastes, on ealra worulda woruld
We should imitate these shepherds, and glorify and praise our Lord for all those things which he hath done for love of us, for our redemption and eternal bliss, to whom be glory and praise with the Almighty Father, in unity of the Holy Ghost, world without end

Amen
Amen

We rædað on ðære béc þe is geháten Actus Apostolorum, þǽt ða apostolas gehádodon seofon diaconas on ðære gelaðunge þe of Iudeiscum folce to Cristes geleafan beah, æfter his ðrowunge, and ǽriste of deaðe, and upstige to heofenum
We read in the book which is called The Acts of the Apostles, that the apostles ordained seven deacons in the congregation which, from among the Jewish people, had turned to Christ's faith, after his passion, and resurrection from death, and ascension to heaven

Þæra diacona wæs se forma Stephanus, þe we on ðisum dæge wurðiað
Of these deacons the first was Stephen, to whom we do honour on this day

He wæs swiðe geleafful, and mid þam Halgum Gaste afylled
He was of great faith, and filled with the Holy Ghost

Þa oðre six wæron gecigede ðisum namum: Stephanus wæs se fyrmesta, oðer Philippus, þridda Procorus, feorða Nicanor, fifta Timotheus, sixta Parmenen, seofoða Nicolaus
The six others were called by these names: Stephen was the first, the second Philip, the third Prochorus, the fourth Nicanor, the fifth Timothy, the sixth Parmenas, the seventh Nicolas

Ðas seofon hí gecuron and gesetton on ðæra apostola gesihðe, and hi ða mid gebedum and bletsungum to diaconum gehadode wurdon
They chose these seven, and set them in the presence of the apostles, and they then, with prayers and blessings, were ordained deacons

Weox ða dæghwonlice Godes bodung, and wæs gemenigfylld þæt getel cristenra manna þearle on Hierusalem
The preaching of God waxed then daily, and the number of christian men was greatly multiplied in Jerusalem

Þa wearð se eadiga Stephanus mid Godes gife, and mid micelre strencðe afylled, and worhte forebeacena and micele tácna on ðam folce
Then was the blessed Stephen filled with God's grace, and with great strength, and he wrought miracles and great signs among the people

Ða astodon sume ða ungeleaffullan Iudei, and woldon mid heora gedwylde þæs eadigan martyres láre oferswiðan
Then arose some of the unbelieving Jews, and would with their error quell the blessed martyr's doctrine

ac hi ne mihton his wisdome wiðstandan, ne ðam Halgum Gaste, ðe ðurh hine spræc
but they could not withstand his wisdom, nor the Holy Ghost, who spake through him

Þa setton hí lease gewitan, ðe hine forlugon, and cwædon, þæt hé tállice word spræce be Moyse and be Gode
Then they set false witnesses, who belied him, and said that he spake blasphemous words of Moses and of God

Þæt folc wearð ða micclum astyred, and þa heafod-menn, and þa Iudeiscan boceras, and gelæhton Stephanum, and tugon to heora geþeahte, and ða leasan gewitan him on besædon
The people were then greatly excited, and the elders, and the Jewish scribes, and they seized Stephen, and drew him to their council, and the false witnesses said of him

Ne geswicð ðes man to sprecenne tallice word ongean þas halgan stowe and Godes ǽ
This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and God's law

We gehyrdon hine secgan þæt Crist towyrpð þas stowe, and towent ða gesetnysse ðe ús Moyses tæhte
We heard him say that Christ shall destroy this place, and change the usages which Moses hath taught us

Þa beheoldon ða hine ðe on þam geðeahte sæton, and gesawon his nebwlite swylce sumes engles ansyne
Then looked on him they who sate in the council, and saw his countenance like the face of an angel

Ða cwæð se ealdor-biscop to ðam eadigan cyðere
Then said the chief priest to the blessed martyr

Is hit swa hí secgað
Is it as they say

Ða wolde se halga wer Stephanus heora ungeleaffullan heortan gerihtlæcan mid heora forðfædera gebysnunge}} and gemynde, and to soðfæstnysse wege mid ealre lufe gebigan
Then would the holy man Stephen rectify their unbelieving hearts with the example and remembrance of their forefathers, and, with all love, incline them to the way of truth

Begann ða him to reccenne be ðam heahfædere Abrahame, hu se heofenlica God hine geceas him to geþoftan, and him behet, þæt ealle ðeoda on his ofspringe gebletsode wurdon, for his gehyrsumnesse
He began then to relate to them concerning the patriarch Abraham, how the God of heaven chose him for associate, and promised him, that all nations should be blessed in his offspring, for his obedience

Swa eac ðæra oðra heahfædera gemynd, mid langsumere race, ætforan him geniwode
In like manner, in a long narrative, he renewed before them the memory of the other patriarchs

and hu Moyses, ðurh Godes mihte, heora foregengan ofer ða Readan Sæ wundorlice gelædde, and hú hí siððan feowertig geara on westene wæron, mid heofenlicum bigleofan dæghwonlice gereordode
and how Moses, through God's might, wonderfully led their forefathers over the Red Sea, and how they afterwards were forty days in the waste, daily fed with heavenly food

and hu God hí lædde to ðam Iudeiscan earde, and ða hæðenan ðeoda ætforan heora gesihðum eallunga adwæscte
and how God led them to the Jewish country, and wholly destroyed before their sight all the heathen nations

and be Dauides mærðe, þæs mæran cyninges, and Salomones wuldre, ðe Gode þæt mære tempel arærde
and of David the great king's greatness, and of Solomon's glory, who the great temple raised to God

Cwæð þa æt nextan
At last he said

Ge wiðstandað þam Halgum Gaste mid stiðum swuran, and ungeleaffulre heortan
Ye withstand the Holy Ghost with stiff neck and unbelieving heart

ge sind meldan and manslagan, and ge ðone rihtwisan Crist niðfullice acwealdon
ye are betrayers and murderers, and the righteous Christ ye enviously slew

ge underfengon ǽ on engla gesetnysse, and ge hit ne heoldon
ye have received a law by the disposition of angels, and ye have held it not

Hwæt ða Iudeiscan þa wurdon þearle on heora heortan astyrode, and biton heora teð him togeanes
Then were the Jews greatly disturbed in their heart, and gnashed their teeth against him

Se halga Stephanus wearð þa afylled mid þam Halgum Gaste, and beheold wið heofonas weard, and geseah Godes wuldor, and þone Hælend standende æt his Fæder swiðran
But the holy Stephen was filled with the Holy Ghost, and looked towards heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right of his Father

and he cwæð
and he said

Efne ic geseo heofenas opene, and mannes Sunu standende æt Godes swiðran
Behold, I see the heavens open, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God

Iudei ða, mid micelre stemne hrymende, heoldon heora earan, and anmodlice him to scuton, and hi hine gelæhton, and of ðære byrig gelæddon to stænenne
Then the Jews, crying with a loud voice, held their ears, and with one accord rushed on him, and seized him, and led him out of the city to be stoned

Þa leas-gewitan ða lédon heora hacelan ætforan fotum sumes geonges cnihtes, se wæs geciged Saulus
The false witnesses then laid their coats before the feet of a young man who was called Saul

Ongunnon ða oftorfian mid heardum stanum ðone eadigan Stephanum
They then begun to stone with hard stones the blessed Stephen

and hé clypode, and cwæð
and he cried, and said

Drihten Hǽlend, onfóh minne gast
Lord Jesus, receive my spirit

And gebigde his cneowu, mid micelre stemne clypigende
And he bowed his knees, crying with a loud voice

Min Drihten, ne sete ðu ðas dæda him to synne
My Lord, place not thou these deeds to them as sin

And hé mid þam worde ða gewát to ðan Ælmihtigum Hælende, þe he on heofenan healicne standende geseah
And he then with that word departed to the Almighty Saviour, whom he had seen standing high in heaven

Se wisa Augustinus spræc ymbe ðas rædinge, and smeade hwí se halga cyðere Stephanus cwæde þæt he gesawe mannes bearn standan æt Godes swyðran, and nolde cweðan Godes bearn
The wise Augustine spake touching this text, and inquired, why the holy martyr Stephen said that he saw the Son of man standing at God's right hand, and would not say the Son of God

þonne ðe is geþuht wurðlicor be Criste to cweðenne Godes Bearn ðonne mannes Bearn
when it seemed worthier of Christ to be called the Son of God than the Son of man

Ac hit gedafenode þæt se Hælend swa geswutelod wære on heofenum, and swa gebodod on middangearde
But it was fitting that Jesus should be so manifested in heaven, and so announced on earth

Eall ðæra Iudeiscra teona aras þurh þæt, hwí Drihten Crist, seðe æfter flæsce soðlice is mannes Sunu, eac swilce wære gecweden Godes Sunu
All the malice of the Jews arose in this, Why the Lord Christ, who, after the flesh, is truly the Son of man, should also be called the Son of God

forði gemunde swiðe gedafenlice þæt godcunde gewrit, mannes Sunu standan æt Godes swiðran to gescyndenne þæra Iudeiscra úngeleaffulnysse
for the holy writ hath very properly mentioned the Son of man standing at the right hand of God, to shame the disbelief of the Jews

Crist wæs æteowed his eadigan cyðere Stephane on heofenum, seðe fram ungeleaffullum on middangearde acweald wæs, and seo heofenlice soðfæstnyss be ðam cydde gecyðnysse, þone seo eorðlice arleasnyss huxlice tælde
Christ was manifested in heaven to his blessed martyr Stephen, who was slain by the unbelievers on earth, and the heavenly truth gave testimony of him, whom earthly wickedness had shamefully calumniated

Hwá mæg beon rihtlice gecíged mannes Bearn, buton Criste anum, þonne ælc man is twegra manna bearn, buton him anum
Who can rightly be called the Son of man, save Christ only, when every man besides him is the son of two persons

Se eadiga Stephanus geseah Crist standan, forðan þe he wæs his gefylsta on ðam gastlicum gefeohte his martyrdomes
The blessed Stephen saw Christ standing, because he was his support in the spiritual fight of his martyrdom

Witodlice we andettað on urum credan, þæt Drihten sitt æt his Fæder swiðran
Verily we confess in our creed that the Lord sits at the right hand of his Father

Setl gedafenað déman, and steall fylstendum oððe feohtendum
A seat is befitting to a judge, and standing to one helping or fighting

Nu andet ure geleafa Cristes setl, forðan ðe hé is se soða déma lybbendra and deadra: and se eadiga cyðere Stephanus híne geseah standende, forðan ðe he wæs his gefylsta, swa swa we ǽr sædon
Now our creed acknowledges Christ's seat, because he is the true Judge of the living and the dead: and the blessed martyr Stephen saw him standing, because he was his helper, as we before said

Ealra gecorenra halgena deað is deorwurðe on Godes gesihðe
The death of all the chosen saints is precious in the sight of God

ac ðeah-hwæðere is geþuht, gif ænig todál beon mæg betwux martyrum, þæt se is healicost seðe ðone martyrdom æfter Gode astealde
yet it seems, if any difference may be between martyrs, that he is the most exalted who suffered martyrdom next to God

Witodlice Stephanus wæs to diacone gehádod æt ðæra apostola handum
Now Stephen was ordained deacon at the hands of the apostles

ac hé hí forestóp on heofenan rice mid sigefæstum deaðe
but he preceded them in the kingdom of heaven by a triumphant death

and swa se ðe wæs neoðor on endebyrdnysse, wearð fyrmest on ðrowunge
and so he who was lower in order was first in suffering

and se ðe wæs leorning-cniht on háde, ongann wesan láreow on martyrdome
and he who was a disciple in condition was the earliest to be a doctor in martyrdom

Ðone deað soðlice þe se Hælend gemedemode for mannum þrowian, ðone ageaf Stephanus fyrmest manna þam Hælende
That death verily which Jesus vouchsafed to suffer for men, Stephen gave first of men to Jesus

He is gecweden protomartyr, þæt is se forma cyðere, forðan ðe hé æfter Cristes ðrowunge ærest martyrdóm geðrowode
He is called protomartyr, that is the first witness, because he first after Christ's passion suffered martyrdom

Stephanus is Grecisc nama, þæt is on Leden, Coronatus, þæt we cweðað on Englisc, Gewuldorbeagod, forðan ðe hé hæfð þone ecan wuldorbeah, swa swa his nama him forewítegode
Stephen is a Greek name, which is in Latin, Coronatus, and which we express in English by, Glory-crowned, because he has the eternal crown of glory, as his name foretold to him

Þa leasan gewitan, ðe hine forsædon, híne ongunnon ærest to torfienne
The lying witnesses, who had falsely accused him, begun first to stone him

forðan þe Moyses ǽ tæhte, þæt swa hwá swa oðerne to deaðe forsǽde, sceolde wurpan ðone forman stán to ðam ðe hé ær mid his tungan acwealde
because the law of Moses taught, that whosoever accused another to death should throw the first stone against him whom he had before slain with his tongue

Ða reðan Iudei wedende þone halgan stǽndon: and hé clypode, and cwæð
The cruel Jews raging stoned the holy one, and he cried and said

Drihten, ne sete ðu ðas dǽda him to synne
Lord, place thou not these deeds to them as sin

Understandað nu, mine gebroðra, þa micclan lufe þæs eadigan weres
Understand now, my brethren, the great love of this blessed man

On deaðe hé wæs gesett, and ðeah he bæd mid soðre lufe for his cwelleras
He was placed in death, and yet he prayed with true love for his slayers

and betwux ðæra stana hryre, ðaða gehwá mihte his leofostan frynd forgytan, ða betæhte hé his fynd Gode, þus cweðende
and amid the falling of the stones, when any one might forget his dearest friends, he commended his foes to God, thus saying

Drihten, ne sete þu ðas dæda him to synne
Lord, place thou not these deeds to them as sin

Swiðor he besorgade þa heora synna þonne his agene wunda, swiðor heora arleasnysse þonne his sylfes deað
He was more afflicted on account of their sins than of his own wounds, more for their wickedness than his own death

and rihtlice swiðor, forðan ðe heora arleasnysse fyligde se eca deað, and þæt ece líf fyligde his deaðe
and rightly more, seeing that eternal death followed their wickedness, and eternal life followed his death

Saulus heold ðæra leasra gewitena reaf, and heora mod to þære stæninge geornlice tihte
Saul held the garments of the false witnesses, and zealously instigated their minds to the stoning

Stephanus soðlice gebigedum cneowum Drihten bæd þæt hé Saulum alysde
But Stephen with bended knees besought the Lord that he would redeem Saul

Wearð ða Stephanes bén fram Gode gehyred, and Saulus wearð alysed
Stephen's prayer was heard, and Saul was redeemed

Se árfæsta wæs gehyred, and se arleasa wearð gerihtwisod
The pious one was heard, and the impious justified

On ðyssere dæde is geswutelod hu micclum fremige þære soðan lufe gebed
By this deed is shown how greatly avails the prayer of true love

Witodlice næfde Godes gelaðung Paulum to lareowe, gif se halga martyr Stephanus swa ne bæde
Verily the church of God would not have had Paul as a teacher, if the holy martyr Stephen had not thus prayed

Efne nú Paulus blissað mid Stephane on heofenan rice
Behold, Paul now rejoices with Stephen in the kingdom of heaven

mid Stephane hé bricð Cristes beorhtnysse, and mid him hé rixað
with Stephen he enjoys the brightness of Christ, and with him he rules

Þider ðe Stephanus forestóp, mid Saules stanum oftorfod, ðider folgode Paulus gefultumod þurh Stephanes gebedu
Whither Stephen preceded, stoned with the stones of Saul, thither Paul followed, aided by the prayers of Stephen

Þær nis Paulus gescynd þurh Stephanes slege, ac Stephanus gladað on Paules gefærrædene, forðan þe seo soðe lufu on heora ægðrum blissað
Paul is not there defiled through Stephen's murder, but Stephen rejoices in the fellowship of Paul, because true love rejoices in them both

Seo soðe lufu oferwann ðæra Iudeiscra reðnysse on Stephane, and seo ylce lufu oferwreah synna micelnysse on Paule, and heo on heora ægðrum samod geearnode heofenan rice
True love overcame the cruelty of the Jews to Stephen, and the same love covered over the greatness of his sins in Paul, and it in both of them together earned the kingdom of heaven

Eornostlice seo soðe lufu is wylspring and ordfruma ealra godnyssa and æðele trumnys, and se weg þe lǽt to heofonum
Verily true love is the fountain and origin of all goodness, and noble fortitude, and the way that leads to heaven

Se ðe færð on soðre lufe ne mæg hé dwelian, ne forhtian: heo gewissað, and gescylt, and gelæt
He who journeys in true love cannot err nor fear: it directs, and shields, and leads

Þurh þa soðan lufe wæs þes halga martyr swa gebyld þæt he bealdlice ðæra Iudeiscra ungeleaffulnysse ðreade, and he órsorh betwux ðam greatum hagolstanum þurhwunode
Through true love was the holy martyr rendered so courageous that he boldly reproved the disbelief of the Jews, and he continued tranquil amid the great stones, and benevolently prayed for the stoners, and, in addition thereto, entered the heavenly hall living, and crowned with glory

Mine gebroðra, uton geefenlæcan be sumum dæle swa miccles lareowes geleafan, and swa mæres cyðeres lufe
My brethren, let us in some degree imitate so great a teacher's faith, and so great a martyr's love

Uton lufian ure gebroðra on Godes gelaðunge mid swilcum mode swa swa ðes cyðere þa lufode his fynd
Let us love our brothers in God's church with such affection as that with which this martyr loved his foes

Beoð gemyndige hwæt seo sylfe Soðfæstnys on ðam halgan godspelle behét, and hwilc wedd us gesealde
Be mindful what Truth itself has promised in the holy gospel, and what pledge it has given us

Jesus said

Gif ge forgyfað þam mannum þe wið eow agyltað, þonne forgyfð eow eower Fæder eowere synna: gif ge ðonne nellað forgyfan, nele eac eower Fæder eow forgifan eowere gyltas
If ye forgive those men who sin against you, then will your heavenly Father forgive you your sins: but if ye will not forgive, your Father will not forgive you your sins

Ge gehyrað nu, mine gebroðra, þæt hit stent þurh Godes gyfe on urum agenum dihte hu ús bið æt Gode gedémed
Ye hear now, my brethren, that it stands, through God's grace, at our own option how we shall be judged before God

He cwæð
He said

Gif ge forgyfað, eow bið forgyfen
If ye forgive, ye shall be forgiven

Ne bepæce nán man hine sylfne: witodlice gif hwa furðon ænne man hatað on ðisum middangearde, swa hwæt swa he to góde gedéð, eal he hit forlyst
Let no man deceive himself: verily if any one hate a man in this world, whatever good he may have done, he loses it all

forðan ðe se apostol Paulus ne bið geligenod, þe cwæð
for the apostle Paul speaks not falsely, who says

Þeah ðe ic aspende ealle mine æhta on ðearfena bigleofan, and ðeah ðe ic minne agenne lichaman to cwale gesylle, swa ðæt ic forbyrne on martyrdome, gif ic næbbe ða soðan lufe, ne fremað hit me nan ðing
Though I spend all my wealth in food for the poor, and though I give my own body to be slain, so that I burn in martyrdom, if I have not true love, it profiteth me nothing

Be ðan ylcan cwæð se godspellere Iohannes
Concerning the same the evangelist John said

Seðe his broðor ne lufað, he wunað on deaðe
He who loveth not his brother continueth in death

Eft hé cwæð
Again he said

Ælc ðæra þe his broðor hatað is manslaga
Every one who hateth his brother is a murderer

Ealle we sind gebroðra þe on God gelyfað, and we ealle cweðað
We are all brothers who believe in God, and we all say

Pater noster qui es in celis
Pater noster qui es in cœlis

þæt is
that is

Ure Fæder þe eart on heofonum
Our Father who art in heaven

Ne gedyrstlæce nan man be mægðhade, butan soðre lufe
Let no man presume on kinship without true love

Ne truwige nan man be ælmesdædum oððe on gebedum, butan ðære foresædan lufe
Let no man trust in alms-deeds, or in prayers, without the aforesaid love

forðan ðe swa lange swa hé hylt ðone sweartan nið on his heortan, ne mæg he mid nanum ðinge þone mildheortan God gegladian
for so long as he holds black malice in his heart, he cannot in any way delight the merciful God

Ac gif he wille þæt him God milde sý, þonne hlyste hé gódes rædes, na of minum muðe, ac of Cristes sylfes: he cwæð
But if he desire that God be merciful to him, let him listen to good counsel, not from my mouth, but from that of Christ himself: he said

Gif ðu offrast ðine lác to Godes weofode, and þu þær gemyndig bist þæt ðin broðor hæfð sum ðing ongean ðe, forlæt ðærrihte ða lác ætforan ðam weofode, and gang ærest to þinum breðer, and þe to him gesibsuma, and ðonne ðu eft cymst to ðam weofode, geoffra ðonne ðine lác
If thou offerest thy gift at God's altar, and thou there rememberest that thy brother hath something against thee, leave forthwith the gift before the altar, and go first to thy brother, and reconcile thee to him, and when thou comest again to the altar, offer then thy gift

Gif ðu ðonne þinum cristenum breðer deredest, þonne hæfð he sum ðing ongean ðe, and þu scealt be Godes tæcunge hine gegladian, ær ðu ðine lác geoffrige
But if thou hast injured thy christian brother, then hath he something against thee, and thou shalt, according to God's teaching, gladden him, ere thou offerest thy gift

Gif ðonne se cristena mann, þe ðin broðor is, ðe ahwar geyfelode, þæt ðu scealt miltsigende forgifan
But if the christian man, who is thy brother, hath in aught done thee evil, that thou shalt mercifully forgive

Ure gastlican lác sind ure gebedu, and lofsang, and husel-halgung, and gehwilce oðre lác ðe we Gode offriað, þa we sceolon mid gesibsumere heortan and broðerlicere lufe Gode betæcan
Our spiritual gifts are our prayers, and hymn, and housel-hallowing, and every other gift that we offer to God, which we should give to God with peaceful heart and brotherly love

Nu cwyð sum man ongean ðas rædinge, Ne mæg ic minne feond lufian, ðone ðe ic dæghwonlice wælhreowne togeanes me geseo
Now will some man say against this text, I cannot love my foe, whom I see daily bloodthirsty against me

Eala ðu mann, þu sceawast hwæt ðin broðor þe dyde, and þu ne sceawast hwæt ðu Gode gedydest
O thou man, thou seest what thy brother hath done to thee, but thou seest not what thou hast done to God

Þonne ðu micele swærran synna wið God gefremodest, hwí nelt ðu forgyfan ða lytlan gyltas anum menn, þæt se Ælmihtiga God þe ða micclan synna forgyfe
When thou much heavier sins hast perpetrated against God, why wilt thou not forgive one man little offences, that the Almighty God may forgive thee great sins

Nu cwyst ðu eft, Micel gedeorf bið me þæt ic minne feond lufige, and for ðone gebidde þe me hearmes cepð
Now again thou wilt say, It is a great hardship for me to love my foe, and to pray for him who meditates harm against me

Ne wiðcweðe we þæt hit micel gedeorf ne sy
We will not gainsay that it is a great hardship

ac gif hit is hefigtyme on ðyssere worulde, hit becymð to micelre mede on ðære toweardan
but if it is difficult in this world, it turns to a great reward in the one to come

Witodlice þurh ðines feondes lufe þu bist Godes freond, and na þæt an þæt ðu his freond sy, ac eac swilce þu bist Godes bearn, þurh ða rædene þæt þu þinne feond lufige
Verily by love of thy foe thou art the friend of God, and not only art thou his friend, but thou art also a child of God, by the condition that thou love thy foe

swa swa Crist sylf cwæð
as Christ himself hath said

Lufiað eowere fynd, doð þam tela þe eow hatiað, þæt ge beon eoweres Fæder cild, seðe on heofenum is
Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, that ye be your Father's children, who is in heaven

Many hardships and contumelies any one would easily endure that he might be accounted the child of some powerful man, and his heir to transitory possessions: bear now patiently, for the everlasting honour of being accounted children of God, and his heirs in heavenly riches, that which the other would undergo for a frail matter

We secgað eow Godes riht
We tell you God's law

hold it if ye will

Gif we hit forsuwiað, ne bið us geborgen
If we kept it in silence, we should not be secure

Cristes lufu us neadað þæt we simle þa gódan tihton, þæt hí on gódnysse þurhwunion
Love of Christ compels us ever to stimulate the good, that they continue in goodness

and ða yfelan we mynegiað, þæt hí fram heora yfelnessum hrædlice gecyrron
and we admonish the wicked that they may quickly turn from their wickedness

Ne beo se rihtwisa gymeleas on his anginne, ne se yfela ortruwige ðurh his unrihtwisnysse
Let not the righteous be heedless at his beginning, nor the wicked despair through his unrighteousness

Ondræde se goda þæt hé fealle
Let the good man dread lest he fall

hogige se yfela þæt hé astande
the wicked take care that he stand

Se ðe yfel sy geefenlæce hé Paules gecyrrednysse
Let him who is wicked imitate the conversion of Paul

se ðe gód sy þurhwunige hé on gódnysse mid Stephane
let him who is good persist in goodness with Stephen

forðan ðe ne bið nán anginn herigendlic butan godre geendunge
for no beginning is praiseworthy without a good ending

Ælc lof bið on ende gesungen
All praise will be sung at the end

My brethren, yesterday our Lord vouchsafed to visit this world in true human nature: now to-day the noble champion Stephen, quitting his bodily dwelling, went triumphant to heaven

Crist niðer-astáh, mid flæsce bewæfed
Christ descended clothed with flesh

Stephanus up-astáh, þurh his blod gewuldorbeagod
Stephen ascended, through his blood with glory crowned

Gyrstan-dæg sungon englas
Yesterday angels sung

Gode wuldor on heannyssum
Glory to God in the highest

now to-day they received Stephen rejoicing in their fellowship, with whom he glorieth and rejoiceth to all eternity

Amen
Amen

Iohannes se Godspellere, Cristes dyrling, wearð on ðysum dæge to heofenan rices myrhðe, þurh Godes neosunge, genumen
John the Evangelist, Christ's darling, was on this day, through God's visitation, taken to the joy of the kingdom of heaven

He wæs Cristes moddrian sunu, and he hine lufode synderlice, na swa micclum for ðære mæglican sibbe swa for ðære clænnysse his ansundan mægðhades
He was the son of Christ's maternal aunt, and he loved him particularly, not so much for the consanguinity, as for the purity of his uncorrupted chastity

He wæs on mægðháde Gode gecoren, and hé on ecnysse on ungewemmedum mægðhade þurhwunode
He was in chastity chosen to God, and he ever continued in undefiled chastity

Hit is geræd on gewyrdelicum racum þæt hé wolde wífian, and Críst wearð to his gyftum gelaðod
It is read in historic narratives that he would marry, and Christ was invited to his nuptials

Þa gelámp hit þæt æt ðam gyftum wín wearð ateorod
Then it befell that at the nuptials wine was wanting

Se Hælend ða het þa ðenig-men afyllan six stænene fatu mid hluttrum wætere, and he mid his bletsunge þæt wæter to æðelum wine awende
Jesus then bade the serving men fill six stone vessels with pure water, and he with his blessing turned the water to noble wine

Þis is þæt forme tácn ðe hé on his menniscnysse openlice geworhte
This is the first miracle that he openly wrought in his state of man

Þa wearð Iohannes swa onbryrd þurh þæt tácn, þæt hé ðærrihte his bryde on mægðhade forlét, and symle syððan Drihtne folgode, and wearð ða him inweardlice gelufod, forðan ðe he hine ætbræd þam flæsclicum lustum
Now John was so stimulated by that miracle, that he forthwith left his bride in maidenhood, and ever afterwards followed the Lord, and was by him inwardly beloved, because he had withdrawn himself from fleshly lusts

Witodlice ðisum leofan leorning-cnihte befæste se Hælend his modor, þaþa hé on rode hengene mancynn alysde, þæt his clæne líf ðæs clænan mædenes Marian gymde, and heo ða on hyre swyster suna ðenungum wunode
Verily to this beloved disciple Jesus intrusted his mother, when, suspended on the cross, he redeemed mankind, that his pure life might take care of the pure virgin Mary, and that she might continue ministering to her sister's son

Eft on fyrste, æfter Cristes upstige to heofonum, rixode sum wælhreow casere on Romana ríce, æfter Nerone, se wæs Domicianus gehaten, cristenra manna ehtere
Some time after, after Christ's ascension to heaven, a cruel emperor reigned in the Roman empire, after Nero, who was called Domitian, a persecutor of the christians

se het afyllan ane cyfe mid weallendum ele, and þone mæran godspellere þæron het bescufan
He commanded a vat to be filled with boiling oil, and the great evangelist to be thrust therein

ac he, ðurh Godes gescyldnysse, ungewemmed of ðam hatum bæðe eode
but he, through God's protection, went uninjured from that hot bath

Eft ðaða se wælreowa ne mihte ðæs eadigan apostoles bodunge alecgan, þa asende he hine on wræcsið to anum igeoðe þe is Paðmas gecíged, þæt he ðær þurh hungres scearpnysse acwæle
Afterwards, when the cruel one might not suppress the preaching of the blessed apostle, he sent him into exile to an island that is called Patmos, that he there, through sharpness of hunger, might perish

Ac se Ælmihtiga Hælend ne forlét to gymeleaste his gelufedan apostol, ac geswutelode him on ðam wræcsiðe þa toweardan onwrigenysse, be ðære hé awrat ða bóc ðe is gehaten Apocalipsis: and se wælhreowa Domicianus on ðam ylcan geare wearð acweald æt his witena handum
But the Almighty Saviour did not leave his beloved apostle to neglect, but revealed to him, in that exile, the revelation of things to come, concerning which he wrote the book which is called Apocalypse: and the cruel Domitian was slain in the same year by the hand of his senators

and hí ealle anmodlice ræddon þæt ealle his gesetnyssa aydlode wæron
and they all unanimously resolved that all his decrees should be annulled

Þa wearð Nerua, swiðe arfæst man, to casere gecoren
Then was Nerva, a very honourable man, chosen for emperor

Be his geðafunge gecyrde se apostol ongean mid micclum wurðmynte, seðe mid hospe to wræcsiðe asend wæs
With his consent the apostle returned with great worship, he who with contumely had been sent into banishment

Him urnon ongean weras and wif fægnigende, and cweðende
Men and women ran to meet him, rejoicing and saying

Gebletsod is se ðe com on Godes naman
Blessed is he who cometh in the name of God

Mid þam ðe se apostol Iohannes stop into ðære byrig Ephesum, þa bær man him togeanes anre wydewan líc to byrigenne
As the apostle John was entering the city of Ephesus, there was borne towards him the corpse of a widow to be buried

hire nama wæs Drusiana
her name was Drusiana

Heo wæs swiðe gelyfed and ælmesgeorn, and þa ðearfan, ðe heo mid cystigum mode eallunga afedde, dreorige mid wópe ðam líce folgodon
She was of great faith, and gave much in alms, and the poor, whom she had bountifully fed, sad, with weeping, followed the corpse

Ða het se apostol ða bære settan, and cwæð
Then the apostle bade them set down the bier, and said

Min Drihten, Hælend Crist
My Lord, Jesus Christ

Arære ðe, Drusiana
Raise thee, Drusiana

aris, and gecyrr ham, and gearca ús gereordunge on þinum huse
arise, and return home, and prepare refection for us in thy house

Drusiana þa arás swilce of slæpe awreht, and, carfull be ðæs apostoles hæse, ham gewende
Drusiana then arose as if from sleep awakened, and, mindful of the apostle's command, returned home

On ðam oðrum dæge eode se apostol be ðære stræt, þa ofseah he hwær sum uðwita lædde twegen gebroðru, þe hæfdon behwyrfed eall heora yldrena gestreon on deorwurðum gymstanum, and woldon ða tocwysan on ealles þæs folces gesihðe, to wæfersyne, swylce to forsewennysse woruldlicra æhta
On the second day the apostle going in the street, observed where a philosopher was accompanying two brothers, who had turned all their parents' treasure into precious gems, and would crush them in the sight of all the people as a spectacle, in contempt as it were of worldly riches

Hit wæs gewunelic on ðam timan þæt ða ðe woldon woruld-wisdom gecneordlice leornian, þæt hí behwyrfdon heora are on gymstanum, and ða tobræcon
It was common at that time for those who would sedulously learn philosophy, to change their property for gems, and break them in pieces

oððe on sumum gyldenum wecge, and ðone on sǽ awurpan
or for a wedge of gold, and throw it into the sea

þilæs ðe seo smeaung þæra æhta hí æt þære lare hremde
lest the contemplation of those riches should hinder them at their study

Þa clypode se apostol ðone uðwitan Graton him to, and cwæð
Then the apostle called the philosopher Graton to him, and said

Dyslic bið þæt hwa woruldlice speda forhogige for manna hérunge, and beo on Godes dome geniðerod
It is foolish that any one should despise worldly riches for praise of men, and be condemned at God's doom

Ydel bið se læcedom þe ne mæg ðone untruman gehælan
Vain is the medicine that cannot heal the sick

swa bið eac ydel seo lár ðe ne gehælð ðære sawle leahtras and unðeawas
as also is vain the doctrine that healeth not the sins and vices of the soul

Soðlice min lareow Crist sumne cniht ðe gewilnode þæs ecan lifes þysum wordum lærde, Þæt he sceolde ealle his welan beceapian, and þæt wurð ðearfum dælan, gif hé wolde fulfremed beon, and he syððan hæfde his goldhord on heofenum, and ðær to-eacan þæt ece líf
Verily my teacher, Christ, enjoined a youth who desired eternal life, in these words, That he should sell all his wealth, and distribute the value to the poor, if he would be perfect, and he should afterwards have his treasure in heaven, and, in addition thereto, eternal life

Graton ða se uðwita him andwyrde
The philosopher Graton him answered

Þas gymstanas synd tocwysede for ydelum gylpe, ac gif ðin láreow is soð God, gefeg ðas bricas to ansundnysse, þæt heora wurð mæge þearfum fremian
These jewels are crushed for idle vaunt, but if thy teacher is the true God, join the fragments to soundness, that their value may benefit the poor

Iohannes þa gegaderode ðæra gymstana bricas, and beseah to heofonum, þus cweðende
John then gathered the fragments of the jewels, and looked to heaven, thus saying

Drihten Hælend, nis ðe nan ðing earfoðe
Lord Jesus, to thee no thing is difficult

þu ge-edstaðelodest ðisne tobrocenan middangeard on þinum geleaffullum, þurh tácen þære halgan rode
thou didst restore this crushed world for thy faithful, through sign of the holy rood

ge-edstaðela nu þas deorwurðan gymstanas, ðurh ðinra engla handa, þæt ðas nytenan menn þine mihta oncnáwon, and on þe gelyfon
restore now these precious gems, by thy angels' hands, that these ignorant men may acknowledge thy powers, and in thee believe

Hwæt, ða færlice wurdon ða gymstanas swa ansunde, þæt furðon nan tácen þære ærran tocwysednysse næs gesewen
Lo, then suddenly the gems became sound, so that even no sign of their former broken condition was seen

Þa se uðwita Graton samod mid þam cnihtum feoll to Iohannes fotum, gelyfende on God
Then the philosopher Graton, together with the youths, fell forthwith at the feet of John, believing in God

Se apostol hine fullode mid eallum his hirede, and hé ongann Godes geleafan openlice bodian
The apostle baptized him with all his family, and he began openly to preach God's faith

Þa twegen gebroðra, Atticus and Eugenius, sealdon heora gymstanas, and ealle heora æhta dældon wǽdlum, and filigdon þam apostole, and micel menigu geleaffulra him eac to geðeodde
The two brothers, Atticus and Eugenius, gave their gems, and distributed all their wealth to the poor, and followed the apostle, and a great multitude of believers also joined themselves to him

Þa becom se apostol æt sumum sæle to þære byrig Pergamum, þær ða foresædan cnihtas iú ær eardodon, and gesawon heora ðeowan mid godewebbe gefreatewode, and on woruldlicum wuldre scinende
Then on a certain time the apostle came to the city of Pergamus, where the before-mentioned youths formerly dwelt, and saw their servants decorated with fine linen, and shining in worldly splendour

Ða wurdon hí mid deofles flan þurhscotene, and dreorige on mode, þæt hí wædligende on ánum waclicum wæfelse ferdon, and heora ðeowan on woruldlicum wuldre scinende wæron
Then were they pierced through with the devil's darts, and sad in mind, that they in poverty should go with one miserable cloak, and their servants be shining in worldly splendour

Þa undergeat se apostol ðas deoflican facn, and cwæð
Then perceived the apostle the diabolical wiles, and said

Ic geseo þæt eower mód is awend, and eower andwlita, forðan ðe ge eowre speda þearfum dældon, and mines Drihtnes lare fyligdon: gað nu forði to wuda, and heawað incre byrðene gyrda, and gebringað to me
I see that your mind and your countenance are changed, because ye have distributed your riches to the poor, and followed my Lord's doctrine: go now therefore to the wood, and hew a burthen of rods, and bring them to me

Hí dydon be his hæse, and hé on Godes naman ða grenan gyrda gebletsode, and hí wurdon to readum golde awende
They did as he had commanded, and he in God's name blessed the green rods, and they were turned to red gold

Eft cwæð se apostol Iohannes
Again the apostle said

Gað to ðære sǽ-strande, and feccað me papolstanas
Go now to the sea-strand, and fetch me pebble-stones

Hí dydon swa, and Iohannes þa on Godes mægenðrymme hí gebletsode, and hí wurdon gehwyrfede to deorwurðum gymmum
They did so, and John by God's majesty blessed them, and they were turned to precious gems

Þa cwæð se apostol
Then said the apostle

Gað to smiððan, and fandiað þises goldes and ðissera gymstana
Go to the smithy, and try this gold and these gems

Hí ða eodon, and eft comon, þus cweðende
They went, and came again, thus saying

Ealle ðas goldsmiðas secgað þæt hí næfre ær swa clæne gold, ne swa read ne gesawon: eac ðas gym-wyrhtan secgað þæt hi næfre swa deorwurðe gymstanas ne gemetton
All the goldsmiths say that they have never before seen such pure and such red gold: also the jewellers say that they have never before met with such precious gems

Þa cwæð se apostol him to
Then said the apostle to them

Nimað þis gold, and ðas gymstanas, and farað, and bicgað eow land-áre, forðan þe ge forluron ða heofenlican speda
Take this gold and these gems, and go and buy landed property, seeing that ye have lost heavenly riches

Bicgað eow pællene cyrtlas, þæt ge to lytelre hwile scinon swa swa róse, þæt ge hrædlice forweornion
Buy yourselves purple kirtles, that ye for a little while may shine as the rose, that ye may speedily fade

Beoð blowende and welige hwilwendlice, þæt ge ecelice wædlion
Be flourishing and rich for a season, that ye may be poor for ever

Hwæt la, ne mæg se Ælmihtiga Wealdend þurhteon þæt hé do his ðeowan rice for worulde, genihtsume on welan, and unwiðmetenlice scinan
What, may not the Almighty Ruler so act that he make his servants powerful before the world, abounding in wealth, and incomparably to shine

Ac he sette gecámp geleaffullum sawlum, þæt hi gelyfon to geagenne þa ecan welan, ða ðe for his naman þa hwilwendan speda forhógiað
But he has placed warfare for the believing souls, that they may believe in order to possess the eternal riches, they who for his name despise temporary possessions

Ge gehældon untruman on þæs Hælendes naman, ge afligdon deoflu, ge forgeafon blindum gesihðe, and gehwilce uncoðe gehældon
Ye healed the sick in the name of Jesus, ye drove out devils, ye gave sight to the blind, and cured every disease

efne nu is ðeos gifu eow ætbroden, and ge sind earmingas gewordene, ge ðe wæron mære and strange
Behold, now this gift is withdrawn from you, and ye are become poor wretches, ye who were great and strong

Swa micel ege stod deoflum fram eow, þæt hí be eowere hæse þa ofsettan deofolseocan forleton
The devils stood in so great awe of you, that at your behest they forsook the possessed demoniacs

nu ge ondrædað eow deoflu
now ye yourselves dread devils

Þa heofenlican æhta sind us eallum gemæne
The heavenly possessions are common to us all

Nacode we wæron acennede, and nacode we gewitað
Naked we were born, and naked we depart

Þære sunnan beorhtnys, and þæs monan leoht, and ealra tungla sind gemæne þam rican and ðam heanan
The brightness of the sun, and the light of the moon, and of all the stars are common to the high and the low

Rén-scuras, and cyrcan duru, fulluht, and synna forgyfenys, huselgang, and Godes neosung, sind eallum gemæne, earmum and eadigum: ac se ungesæliga gytsere wile mare habban þonne him genihtsumað, þonne he furðon orsorh ne bricð his genihtsumnysse
Rain-showers and the church-door, baptism and forgiveness of sins, partaking of the housel and God's visitation, are common to all, poor and rich: but the unhappy covetous wishes to have more than suffices him, though he enjoys not freedom from care in his abundance

Se gytsere hæfð ænne lichaman, and menigfealde scrúd
The covetous hath one body and divers garments

he hæfð ane wambe, and þusend manna bigleofan
he hath one belly and a thousand men's sustenance

witodlice þæt he for gytsunge úncyste nanum oðrum syllan ne mæg, þæt he hordað, and nat hwam, swa swa se witega cwæð, 'On ídel bið ælc man gedrefed, seðe hordað, and nat hwam he hit gegaderað
but that which he, through the vice of avarice, cannot give to any other, he hoardeth, and knoweth not for whom, as the prophet said, Vainly is every man troubled who hoardeth, and knoweth not for whom he gathereth

Witodlice ne bið he þæra æhta hlaford, þonne he hi dælan ne mæg, ac he bið þæra æhta ðeowa, þonne he him eallunga þeowað
Verily he is not lord of those possessions, when he cannot distribute them, but he is the slave of those possessions, when he wholly serveth them

and þær to-eacan him weaxað untrumnyssa on his lichaman, þæt hé ne mæg ǽtes oððe wǽtes brucan
and in addition thereto, diseases of his body increase, so that he may not enjoy food or drink

Hé carað dæges and nihtes þæt his feoh gehealden sy
He cares night and day that his money be preserved

hé gymð grædelice his teolunge, his gafoles, his gebytlu
he attends greedily to his gain, his rent, his buildings

he berypð þa wánnspedigan, he fulgǽð his lustum and his plegan
he bereaves the indigent, he follows his lusts and his pleasure

þonne færlice gewitt he of ðissere worulde, nacod and forscyldigod, synna ana mid him ferigende
then suddenly departs he from this world, naked and charged with crimes, bearing with him his sins alone

forðan þe he sceal éce wíte ðrowian
therefore shall he suffer punishment everlasting

Efne ðaða se apostol þas lare sprecende wæs, ða bær sum wuduwe hire suna lic to bebyrgenne, se hæfde gewifod þritigum nihtum ǽr
Behold, while the apostle was speaking this lecture, a certain widow bare her son to be buried, who had been married thirty days before

Seo dreorige modor þa samod mid þam licmannum rarigende hí astrehte æt þæs halgan apostoles fotum, biddende þæt he hire sunu on Godes naman arærde, swa swa he dyde þa wydewan Drusianam
The afflicted mother, together with the mourners, wailing prostrated herself at the holy apostle's feet, praying that he would, in God's name, rear up her son, as he did the widow Drusiana

Iohannes ða ofhreow þære meder and ðæra licmanna dreorignysse, and astrehte his lichaman to eorðan on langsumum gebede, and ða æt nextan arás, and eft up-ahafenum handum langlice bæd
John then, pitying the grief of the mother and the mourners, prostrated his body on the earth, in long prayer, and at length rising up, again with up-raised hands prayed a long time

Þaða he ðus ðriwa gedón hæfde, ða het he unwindan þæs cnihtes líc, and cwæð
Having done thus thrice, he bade them unwrap the corpse of the youth, and said

Eala ðu cniht, ðe þurh ðines flæsces lust hrædlice ðine sawle forlure
O thou youth, who through thy flesh's lust hast early lost thy soul

eala þu cniht, þu ne cuðest ðinne Scyppend
O thou youth, thou knewest not thy Creator

þu ne cuðest manna Hælend
thou knewest not the Saviour of men

þu ne cuðest ðone soðan freond, and forði þu beurne on þone wyrstan feond
thou knewest not the true friend, and hast therefore fallen on the worst enemy

Nu ic ageat mine tearas, and for ðinre nytennysse geornlice bæd, þæt þu of deaðe arise, and þisum twam gebroðrum, Attico and Eugenio, cyðe hú micel wuldor hí forluron, and hwilc wite hí geearnodon
Now I have shed my tears, and earnestly prayed for thy sensuality, that thou mayest from death arise, and to these two brothers, Atticus and Eugenius, declare how great glory they have lost, and what punishment they have earned

Mid ðam þa arás se cniht Stacteus, and feoll to Iohannes fotum, and begann to ðreagenne þa gebroðru þe miswende wǽron, þus cweðende
On this the youth Stacteus arose, and fell at the feet of John, and began to chide the brothers who had been perverted, thus saying

Ic geseah þa englas, þe eower gymdon, dreorige wepan, and ða awyrigedan sceoccan blissigende on eowerum forwyrde
I saw the angels who had charge of you sadly weeping, and the accursed fiend rejoicing in your destruction

Eow wæs heofenan rice gearo, and scinende gebytlu mid wistum afyllede, and mid ecum leohte: þa ge forluron þurh unwærscipe, and ge begeaton eow ðeosterfulle wununga mid dracum afyllede, and mid brastligendum ligum, mid unasecgendlicum witum afyllede, and mid anðræcum stencum
For you was the kingdom of heaven ready, and shining structures filled with repasts, and with eternal light: these ye have lost through heedlessness, and have got for yourselves dark dwellings filled with serpents, and with crackling flames, full of unspeakable torments and horrible stenches

on ðam ne ablinð granung and þoterung dæges oþþe nihtes: biddað forði mid inweardre heortan ðysne Godes apostol, eowerne lareow, þæt he eow fram ðam ecum forwyrde arære, swa swa he me fram deaðe arærde
in which groaning and howling cease not day nor night: pray, therefore, with inward heart, this apostle of God, your teacher, that he raise you from eternal perdition, as he hath raised me from death, and that he your souls, which are now blotted from the living book, lead back to God's grace and mercy

Se cniht þa Stacteus, ðe of deaðe arás, samod mid þam gebroðrum, astrehte hine to Iohannes fótswaðum, and þæt folc forð mid ealle, anmodlice biddende þæt he him to Gode geþingode
The youth then, Stacteus, who had risen from death, together with the brothers, prostrated himself in the footsteps of John, and the people with them, all unanimously praying that he would intercede with God for them

Se apostol þa bebead ðam twam gebroðrum þæt hi ðritig daga be hreowsunge dædbetende Gode geoffrodon, and on fæce geornlice bædon, þæt ða gyldenan gyrda eft to þan ærran gecynde awendon, and þa gymstanas to heora wacnysse
The apostle then commanded the two brothers that they for thirty days in penitence should sacrifice to God by penance, and in that space should earnestly pray that the golden rods might be turned again to their former nature, and the gems to their worthlessness

Æfter ðritigra daga fæce, þaþa hí ne mihton mid heora benum þæt gold and þa gymstanas to heora gecynde awendan, ða comon hi mid wope to þam apostole, þus cweðende
After thirty days' space, when they could not by their prayers restore the gold and the gems to their nature, they came with weeping to the apostle, thus saying

Symle ðu tæhtest mildheortnysse, and þæt man oðrum miltsode
Ever hast thou taught mercy, and that one should have mercy on another

and gif man oðrum miltsað, hu micele swiðor wile God miltsian and arian mannum his hand-geweorce
and if one have mercy on another, how much more will God show mercy to and pity men, his handiwork

Þæt þæt we mid gitsigendum eagum agylton, þæt we nu mid wependum eagum bereowsiað
The sin which we have committed with covetous eyes, we now with weeping eyes repent

Ða andwyrde se apostol
Then answered the apostle

Berað ða gyrda to wuda, and þa stanas to sǽ-strande: hi synd gecyrrede to heora gecynde
Bear the rods to the wood, and the stones to the sea-strand: they shall be restored to their nature

Þaða hi þis gedon hæfdon, ða underfengon hi eft Godes gife, swa þæt hi adræfdon deoflu, and blinde, and untrume gehældon, and fela tacna on Drihtnes naman gefremedon, swa swa hi ær dydon
When they had done this they again received God's grace, so that they drove out devils, and healed the blind and the sick, and performed many miracles, in the Lord's name, as they before had done

Se apostol þa gebigde to Gode ealne þone eard Asiam, se is geteald to healfan dæle middan-eardes
The apostle then converted to God all the}} country of Asia, which is accounted the half part of the world

and awrat ða feorðan Cristes bóc, seo hrepað swyðost ymbe Cristes godcundnysse
and wrote the fourth book of Christ, which treats most of Christ's divinity

Ða oðre þry godspelleras, Matheus, Marcus, Lucas, awriton æror be Cristes menniscnysse
The other three evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, wrote rather of Christ's human state

Þa asprungon gedwolmenn on Godes gelaðunge, and cwædon þæt Crist nære ær he acenned wæs of Marian
Then there sprung up heretics in God's church, who said that Christ was not before he was born of Mary

Þa bædon ealle þa leod-bisceopas ðone halgan apostol þæt he þa feorðan bóc gesette, and þæra gedwolmanna dyrstignesse adwæscte
Thereupon all the diocesan bishops besought the holy apostle to compose the fourth book, and extinguish the audacity of the heretics

Iohannes þa bead ðreora daga fæsten gemænelice
John then ordered a general fast of three days

and he æfter ðam fæstene wearð swa miclum mid Godes gaste afylled, þæt he ealle Godes englas, and ealle gesceafta, mid heahlicum mode oferstáh, and mid ðysum wordum þa godspellican gesetnysse ongan
and after the fast he was so greatly filled with the spirit of God, that he excelled all God's angels and all creatures with his exalted mind, and began the evangelical memorial with these words

In principio erat uerbum, et reliqua
In principio erat verbum, etc

þæt is on Englisc
that is in English

On frymðe wæs word, and þæt word wæs mid Gode, and þæt word wæs God
In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God

þis wæs on frymðe mid Gode
this was in the beginning with God

ealle ðing sind þurh hine geworhte, and nis nan þing buton him gesceapen
all things are made through him, and without him nothing is created

And swa forð on ealre þære godspellican gesetnysse, he cydde fela be Cristes godcundnysse, hu he ecelice butan angynne of his Fæder acenned is, and mid him rixað on annysse þæs Halgan Gastes, á butan ende
And so forth, in all the evangelical memorial, he made known many things concerning Christ's divinity, how he eternally without beginning was begotten of his Father, and reigneth with him in unity of the Holy Ghost, ever without end

Feawa he awrat be his menniscnysse, forðan þe þa ðry oðre godspelleras genihtsumlice be þam heora bec setton
He wrote few things of his human nature, because the three other evangelists had composed their books abundantly concerning that

Hit gelamp æt sumum sæle þæt þa deofolgyldan þe þa gýt ungeleaffulle wǽron, gecwædon þæt hi woldon þone apostol to heora hæðenscipe geneadian
It happened at a certain time, that the idolaters, who were yet unbelieving, said that they would force the apostle to their heathenship

Þa cwæð se apostol to ðam hæðengyldum
whereupon the apostle said to the idolaters

Gað ealle endemes to Godes cyrcan, and clypiað ealle to eowerum godum, þæt seo cyrce afealle ðurh heora mihte
Go all together to God's church, and call all of you to your gods that, through their might, the church may fall down

ðonne buge ic to eowerum hæðenscipe
then will I turn to your heathenship

Gif ðonne eower godes miht þa halgan cyrcan towurpan ne mæg, ic towurpe eower tempel þurh ðæs Ælmihtigan Godes mihte, and ic tocwyse eower deofolgyld
But if the power of your god may not cast down the holy church, I will cast down your temple, through the might of the Almighty God, and I will crush your idol

and bið þonne rihtlic geðuht þæt ge geswycon eoweres gedwyldes, and gelyfon on ðone soðan God, seðe ana is Ælmihtig
and it shall then seem right that ye cease from your error, and believe in the true God, who alone is Almighty

Þa hæðengyldan ðisum cwyde geðwærlæhton, and Iohannes mid geswæsum wordum þæt folc tihte, þæt hí ufor eodon fram þam deofles temple
The idolaters assented to this proposal, and John with kind words exhorted the people to go out from the devil's temple

and mid beorhtre stemne ætforan him eallum clypode
and with clear voice cried before them all

On Godes naman ahreose þis tempel, mid eallum þam deofolgyldum þe him on eardiað, þæt þeos menigu tocnawe þæt ðis hæðengyld deofles biggeng is
In the name of God let this temple fall down with all the idols that dwell within it, that this multitude may know that this idolatry is the worship of the devil

Hwæt ða færlice ahreas þæt tempel grundlunga, mid eallum his anlicnyssum to duste awende
Behold then, the temple fell suddenly to the ground, with all its idols turned to dust

On ðam ylcan dæge wurdon gebigede twelf ðusend hæðenra manna to Cristes geleafan, and mid fulluhte gehalgode
On that same day twelve thousand heathens were turned to belief in Christ, and hallowed with baptism

Þa sceorede ða gyt se yldesta hæðengylda mid mycelre þwyrnysse, and cwæð þæt he nolde gelyfan buton Iohannes attor drunce, and þurh Godes mihte ðone cwelmbæran drenc oferswiðde
But the chief idolater still refused with great perverseness, and said that he would not believe unless John drank poison, and through God's might overcame the deadly drink

Þa cwæð se apostol
Then said the apostle

Þeah þu me attor sylle, þurh Godes naman hit me ne derað
Though thou give me poison, through God's name it shall not hurt me

Ða cwæð se hæðengylda Aristodemus
Then said the idolater Aristodemus

Þu scealt ærest oðerne geseon drincan, and ðærrihte cwelan, þæt huru ðin heorte swa forhtige for ðam deadbærum drence
Thou shalt first see another drink it, and instantly die, that so at least thy heart may fear the death-bearing drink

Iohannes him andwyrde
John answered him

Gif ðu on God gelyfan wylt, ic unforhtmod ðæs drences onfó
If thou wilt believe in God, I will fearless receive this drink

Þa getengde se Aristodemus to ðam heahgerefan, and genám on his cwearterne twegen ðeofas, and sealde him ðone unlybban ætforan eallum ðam folce, on Iohannes gesihðe
Then Aristodemus went to the prefect, and took from his prison two thieves, and gave them the poison before all the people, in the presence of John

and hi ðærrihte æfter þam drence gewiton
and they immediately after the drink died

Syððan se hæðengylda eac sealde ðone attorbæran drenc þam apostole, and hé mid rodetacne his muð, and ealne his lichaman gewǽpnode, and ðone unlybban on Godes naman halsode, and siððan mid gebildum mode hine ealne gedranc
Then the idolater gave the venomous drink also to the apostle, and he having armed his mouth and all his body with the sign of the rood, and exorcised the poison in God's name, with bold heart drank it all

Aristodemus ða and þæt folc beheoldon þone apostol ðreo tída dæges, and gesawon hine habban glædne andwlitan, buton blácunge and forhtunge, and hi ealle clypodon
Aristodemus then and the people beheld the apostle three hours of the day, and saw him having a glad countenance, without paleness and fear: and they all cried

An soð God is, seðe Iohannes wurðað
There is one true God, whom John worshippeth

Þa cwæð se hæðengylda to ðam apostole
Then said the idolater to the apostle

Gyt me tweonað
Yet I doubt

ac gif ðu ðas deadan sceaðan, on ðines Godes naman arærst, þonne bið min heorte geclænsod fram ælcere twynunge
but if thou, in the name of thy God, wilt raise up these dead thieves, then will my heart be cleansed from every doubt

Ða cwæð Iohannes
Then said John

Aristodeme, nim mine tunecan, and lege bufon ðæra deadra manna lic, and cweð, 'Þæs Hælendes Cristes apostol me asende to eow, þæt ge on his naman of deaðe arison, and ælc man oncnáwe þæt deað and líf ðeowiað minum Hælende
Aristodemus, take my tunic, and lay it on the corpses of the dead men, and say, 'The apostle of Jesus Christ hath sent me to you, that ye in his name may arise from death, and that every man may know that death and life minister to my Saviour

He ða be ðæs apostoles hæse bær his tunecan, and alede uppon ðam twám deadum, and hí ðærrihte ansunde arison
He then, at the apostle's command, bare his tunic, and laid it on the two dead ones, and they forthwith rose up whole

Þaða se hæðengylda þæt geseah, ða astrehte he hine to Iohannes fotum, and syððan ferde to ðam heahgerefan, and him ða wundra mid hluddre stemne cydde
When the idolater saw that, he prostrated himself at the feet of John, and then went to the prefect, and announced to him those miracles with a loud voice

Hí ða begen þone apostol gesohton, his miltsunge biddende: Þa bead se apostol him seofon nihta fæsten, and hi siððan gefullode
Then they both sought the apostle, praying for his compassion: whereupon the apostle enjoined them a fast of seven days, and afterwards baptized them

and hi æfter ðam fulluhte towurpon eall heora deofolgyld, and mid heora maga fultume, and mid eallum cræfte arærdon Gode mære cyrcan on ðæs apostoles wurðmynte
and after their baptism they cast down all their idols, and with the aid of their kinsmen, and with all art, raised a great church to God in honour of the apostle

Þaða se apostol wæs nigon and hund-nigontig geara, þa æteowode him Drihten Crist mid þam oðrum apostolum, þe hé of ðisum life genumen hæfde, and cwæð
When the apostle was ninety-nine years old the Lord Christ appeared to him with the other apostles, whom he had taken from this life, and said

Iohannes, cum to me
John, come to me

tima is þæt þu mid ðinum gebroðrum wistfullige on minum gebeorscipe
it is time that thou with thy brethren shouldst feast at my banquet

Iohannes þa arás, and eode wið þæs Hælendes
John then arose, and went towards Jesus

ac he him to cwæð
But he said to him

Nu on sunnan-dæg, mines æristes dæge, þu cymst to me
Lo, on Sunday, the day of my resurrection, thou shalt come to me

and æfter ðam worde Drihten gewende to heofenum
and after those words the Lord returned to heaven

Se apostol micclum blissode on ðam beháte, and on þam sunnan-uhtan ærwacol to ðære cyrcan com, and þam folce, fram hancrede oð undern, Godes gerihta lærde, and him mæssan gesang, and cwæð þæt se Hælend hine on ðam dæge to heofonum gelaðod hæfde
The apostle greatly rejoiced in that promise, and at sunrise early rising came to the church, and from cock-crowing until the third hour, taught God's law, and sang mass to them, and said, that the Saviour had called him to heaven on that day

Het ða delfan his byrgene wið þæt weofod, and þæt greot ut-awegan
He then ordered his grave to be dug opposite the altar, and the dust to be removed

And hé eode cucu and gesund into his byrgene, and astrehtum handum to Gode clypode
and he went quick and whole into his grave, and with outstretched hands cried to God

Drihten Crist, ic þancige ðe þæt þu me gelaðodest to þinum wistum: þu wást þæt ic mid ealre heortan þe gewilnode
Lord Christ, I thank thee that thou hast invited me to thy banquet: thou knowest that with all my heart I have desired thee

Oft ic ðe bæd þæt ic moste to ðe faran, ac ðu cwæde þæt ic anbidode, þæt ic ðe mare folc gestrynde
Oft have I prayed thee that I might go to thee, but thou saidst that I should abide, that I might gain more people to thee

Þu heolde minne lichaman wið ælce besmittennysse, and þu simle mine sawle onlihtest, and me nahwar ne forlete
Thou hast preserved my body against every pollution, and thou hast ever illumined my soul, and hast nowhere forsaken me

Þu settest on minum muðe þinre soðfæstnysse word, and ic awrat ða lare ðe ic of ðinum muðe gehyrde, and ða wundra ðe ic ðe wyrcan geseah
Thou hast set in my mouth the word of thy truth, and I have written down the lore which I heard from thy mouth, and the wonders which I saw thee work

Nu ic ðe betæce, Drihten
Now I commit to thee, Lord

þine bearn, ða ðe þin gelaðung, mæden and moder, þurh wæter and þone Halgan Gast, ðe gestrynde
thy children, those which thy church, maiden and mother, through water and the Holy Ghost have gained to thee

Onfoh me to minum gebroðrum mid ðam ðe ðu come, and me gelaðodest
Receive me to my brothers with whom thou camest and invitedst me

Geopena ongean me lifes geat, þæt ðæra ðeostra ealdras me ne gemeton
Open towards me the gate of life, that the princes of darkness may not find me

Þu eart Crist, ðæs lifigendan Godes Sunu, þu þe be ðines Fæder hæse middangeard gehældest, and us ðone Halgan Gast asendest
Thou art Christ, Son of the living God, who, at thy Father's behest, hast saved the world, and hast sent us the Holy Ghost

Þe we heriað, and þanciað þinra menigfealdra goda geond ungeendode worulde
Thee we praise and thank for thy manifold benefits throughout the world eternal

Amen
Amen

Æfter ðysum gebede æteowode heofenlic leoht bufon ðam apostole, binnon ðære byrgene, ane tid swa beorhte scinende, þæt nanes mannes gesihð þæs leohtes leoman sceawian ne mihte
After this prayer a heavenly light appeared above the apostle, within the grave, shining for an hour so bright, that no man's sight might look on the rays of light

and he mid þam leohte his gast ageaf þam Drihtne þe hine to his rice gelaðode
and with that light he gave up his spirit to the Lord, who had invited him to his kingdom

He gewát swa freoh fram deaðes sarnysse, of ðisum andweardan life, swa swa he wæs ælfremed fram lichamlicere gewemmednysse
He departed as joyfully from the pain of death, from this present life, as he was exempt from bodily defilement

Soðlice syððan wæs his byrgen gemet mid mannan afylled
Verily his grave was afterwards found filled with manna

Manna wæs gehaten se heofenlica mete, þe feowertig geara afedde Israhela folc on westene
Manna the heavenly meat was called which for forty years fed the people of Israel in the wilderness

Nu wæs se bigleofa gemett on Iohannes byrgene, and nan ðing elles, and se mete is weaxende on hire oð ðisne andweardan dæg
Now this food was found in the grave of John, and nothing else, and the meat is growing in it to this present day

Þær beoð fela tacna æteowode, and untrume gehælde, and fram eallum frecednyssum alysede, þurh ðæs apostoles ðingunge
Many miracles have there been manifested, and sick healed, and released from all calamities through the apostle's intercession

Þæs him getiðað Drihten Crist, þam is wuldor and wurðmynt mid Fæder and Halgum Gaste, á butan ende
This hath the Lord Christ granted unto him, to whom is glory and honour with the Father and the Holy Ghost, ever without end

Amen
Amen

Nu to-dæg Godes gelaðung geond ealne ymbhwyrft mærsað þæra eadigra cildra freols-tide, þe se wælhreowa Herodes for Cristes acennednysse mid arleasre ehtnysse acwealde, swa swa us seo godspellice racu swutellice cyð
Now to-day God's church throughout all the globe celebrates the festival of the blessed children whom the cruel Herod, on account of the birth of Christ, slew in impious persecution, as the evangelical narrative manifestly makes known to us

Matheus awrat, on þære forman Cristes bec, ðysum wordum be ðæs Hælendes gebyrd-tide, and cwæð
Matthew wrote, in the first book of Christ, in these words, of the birth-time of Jesus, and said

Þaða se Hælend acenned wæs on þære Iudeiscan Bethleem, on Herodes dagum cyninges, efne ða comon fram east-dæle middangeardes þry tungel-witegan to ðære byrig Hierusalem, þus befrinende, Hwær is Iudeiscra leoda Cyning, seðe acenned is
When Jesus was born in the Judæan Bethlehem, in the days of Herod the king, behold there came from the east part of the earth three astrologers to the city of Jerusalem, thus inquiring, Where is the King of the Jewish people, who is born

We gesawon soðlice his steorran on east-dǽle, and we comon to ði þæt we ús to him gebiddon
Verily we saw his star in the east part, and we come in order that we may worship him

Hwæt ða Herodes cyning þis gehyrende wearð micclum astyred, and eal seo burhwaru samod mid him
Now king Herod hearing this was greatly troubled, and all the citizens together with him

He ða gesamnode ealle þa ealdor-biscopas, and ðæs folces boceras, and befran hwær Cristes cenningstów wære
He then assembled all the chief bishops and scribes of the people, and inquired where the birthplace of Christ might be

Hí sædon, on ðære Iudeiscan Bethleem
They said, In the Judæan Bethlehem

Þus soðlice is awriten þurh ðone witegan Micheam, Eala þu Bethleem, Iudeisc land, ne eart ðu nateshwón wacost burga on Iudeiscum ealdrum: of ðe cymð se Heretoga seðe gewylt and gewissað Israhela folc
Thus verily it is written by the prophet Micah, Ah thou Bethlehem, Judæan land, thou art in no wise meanest of cities among the Jewish princes: of thee shall come the Ruler who shall rule and govern the people of Israel

Ða clypode Herodes þa ðry tungel-witegan on sunder-spræce, and geornlice hí befrán to hwilces timan se steorra him ærst æteowode, and asende hí to Bethleem, ðus cweðende, Farað ardlice, and befrínað be ðam cilde, and þonne ge hit gemetað, cyðað me, þæt ic máge me to him gebiddan
Then Herod called the three astrologers in separate discourse, and diligently questioned them at what time the star had first appeared to them, and sent them to Bethlehem, thus saying, Go instantly, and inquire concerning the child, and when ye find it, let me know, that I may worship him

Þa tungel-witegan ferdon æfter þæs cyninges spræce, and efne ða se steorra, þe hí on east-dǽle gesawon, glad him beforan, oð þæt he gestód bufon ðam gesthúse, þær þæt cild on wunode
After the king's speech the astrologers went, and lo, the star which they had seen in the east part glided before them, till it stood over the inn in which the child was staying

Hi gesáwon ðone steorran, and þearle blissodon
They saw the star and greatly rejoiced

Eodon ða inn, and þæt cild gemetton mid Marian his meder, and niðerfeallende hí to him gebǽdon
They then went in, and found the child with Mary his mother, and falling down they worshipped him

Hi geopenodon heora hórdfatu, and him lác geoffrodon, gold, and recels, and myrram
They opened their cases of treasure and offered him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh

Hwæt ða God on swefne hí gewarnode and bebead þæt hi eft ne cyrdon to ðan reðan cyninge Herode, ac þurh oðerne weg hine forcyrdon, and swa to heora eðele becomon
Then God warned them in a dream, and commanded, that they should not return to the cruel king Herod, but should turn through another way, and so come to their own country

Efne ða Godes engel æteowode Iosepe, ðæs cíldes foster-fæder, on swefnum, cweðende, 'Arís, and nim þis cild mid þære meder, and fleoh to Egypta lánde, and beo þær oð þæt ic þe eft secge: soðlice toweard is þæt Herodes smeað hú hé þæt cild fordó
Lo, God's angel appeared to Joseph, the child's foster-father, in a dream, saying, 'Arise, and take this child with the mother, and flee to the land of Egypt, and be there until I speak to thee again: for it will come to pass that Herod will devise how he may fordo the child

' Ioseph ða arás nihtes, and þæt cild mid þære meder samod to Egypta lánde ferede, and þær wunode oð þæt Herodes gewát
' Joseph then arose by night, and conveyed the child together with the mother to the land of Egypt, and there staid until Herod departed

þæt seo witegung wære gefylled, þe be ðære fare ær ðus cwæð, Of Egypta lánde ic geclypode minne sunu
that the prophecy might be fulfilled which of old thus spake of that journey, From the land of Egypt I have called my son

Nu secgað wyrd-writeras þæt Herodes betwux ðisum wearð gewréged to þam Romaniscan casere, þe ealne middangeard on þam timan geweold
Now chroniclers say that in the meanwhile Herod was accused to the Roman emperor, who at that time ruled all the earth

Þa gewende he to Rome, be ðæs caseres hæse, þæt he hine betealde, gif he mihte
He therefore went, by the emperor's command, to Rome, that he might clear himself, if he could

Þa betealde he hine swiðe geaplice, swa swa he wæs snotorwyrde to ðan swiðe, þæt se casere hine mid maran wurðmynte ongean to Iudeiscum rice asende
He cleared himself very cunningly, as he was so sagacious, that the emperor sent him back with great honour to the Jewish kingdom

Þaþa he ham com, þa gemunde he hwæt he ær be ðan cilde gemynte, and geseah þæt he wæs bepæht fram ðam tungel-witegum, and wearð þa ðearle gegremod
When he came home he remembered what he had intended concerning the child, and saw that he had been deceived by the astrologers, and was exceedingly irritated

Sende ða his cwelleras, and ofsloh ealle ða hyse-cild, þe wǽron on þære byrig Bethleem, and on eallum hyre gemærum, fram twywintrum cilde to anre nihte, be ðære tide þe hé geaxode æt ðam tungel-witegum
He then sent his executioners, and slew all the male children that were in the city of Bethlehem, and in all its boundaries, from the child of two years to that of one day, according to the time which he had inquired of the astrologers

Þa wæs gefylled Hieremias wítegung, þe ðus witegode
Then was fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah, who thus prophesied

Stemn is gehyred on heannysse, micel wóp and ðoterung: Rachel beweop hire cildru, and nolde beon gefrefrod, forðan ðe hi ne sind
A voice is heard on high, great weeping and wailing: Rachel wept for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not

On ðam twelftan dæge Cristes acennednysse comon ða ðry tungel-witegan to Herode, and hine axodon be ðam acennedan cilde
On the twelfth day of Christ's birth the three astrologers came to Herod, and informed him concerning the child that was born

and þaþa hí his cenning-stowe geaxodon, þa gewendon hí wið þæs cildes, and noldon ðone reðan cwellere eft gecyrran, swa swa he het
and when they had discovered his birthplace, they went to the child, and would not return to the cruel murderer, as he had commanded

Þa ne mihte he forbugan þæs caseres hæse, and wæs ða, þurh his langsume fær, þæra cildra slege geuferod swiðor þonne he gemynt hæfde
He might not then avoid the emperor's command, and, therefore, through his long journey, the slaughter of the children was delayed more than he had intended

and hí wurdon ða on ðysum dægþerlicum dæge wuldorfullice gemartyrode
and they were on this present day gloriously martyred

na swa-þeah þæs geares þe Crist acenned wæs, ac æfter twegra geara ymbryne æfter ðæs wælhreowan hamcyme
not, however, in the year that Christ was born, but after the course of two years after the return of the cruel tyrant

Næs hé æðelboren, ne him naht to þam cynecynne ne gebyrode
He was not of noble birth, nor did he belong to the royal race

ac mid syrewungum and swicdome he becom to ðære cynelican geðincðe
but by artifices and deception he attained to the kingly dignity

swa swa Moyses be ðam awrát, Þæt ne sceolde ateorian þæt Iudeisce cynecynn, oþþæt Crist sylf come
as Moses wrote concerning him, That the royal Jewish race should not decay until Christ himself came

Ða com Crist on ðam timan þe seo cynelice mæigð ateorode, and se ælfremeda Herodes þæs rices geweold
Now Christ came at the time that the royal family was decayed, and the stranger Herod ruled the kingdom

Þa wearð he micclum afyrht and anðracode þæt his rice feallan sceolde, þurh to-cyme þæs soðan cyninges
Then was he greatly afraid and terrified lest his kingdom should fall through the coming of the true king

Þa clypode hé ða tungel-witegan on sunder-spræce, and geornlice hí befrán, on hwilcne timan hí ærest þone steorran gesawon
He called therefore the astrologers in separate converse, and diligently questioned them at what time they first saw the star

forðan ðe he ondred, swa swa hit gelamp, þæt hí eft hine ne gecyrdon
for he feared, as it came to pass, that they would not return to him

Þa het he forðy acwellan ealle ða hyse-cild þære burhscire, fram twywintrum cilde oð anre nihte: ðohte gif he hí ealle ofsloge, þæt se án ne ætburste þe he sohte
He therefore commanded all the children of that district, from the age of two years to that of one day, to be slain, that the one might not escape whom he sought

Ac he wæs ungemyndig þæs halgan gewrites, ðe cwyð
But he was unmindful of the holy scripture, which says

Nis nán wisdom, ne nán ræd naht ongean God
No wisdom nor any counsel is aught against God

Se swicola Herodes cwæð to ðam tungel-witegum
The treacherous Herod said to the astrologers

Farað, and geornlice befrinað be ðam cilde, and cyðað me, þæt ic eac mage me to him gebiddan
Go, and diligently inquire concerning the child, and let me know, that I may worship him

Ac he cydde syððan his facenfullan syrewunge, hu he ymbe wolde, gif he hine gemette, ðaða he ealle his efenealdan adylegode for his anes ehtnysse
But he manifested afterwards his guileful artifice, how he would have done, if he had found him, when he destroyed all those of equal age, for the persecution of him alone

Þearflæs he syrwde ymbe Crist: ne com he forðy þæt he wolde his eorðlice rice, oþþe æniges oðres cyninges mid riccetere him to geteon
Needlessly he machinated against Christ: he came not because he would acquire for himself his earthly kingdom, or any other king's by violence

ac to ði hé com þæt he wolde his heofenlice rice geleaffullum mannum forgyfan
but he came because he would give his heavenly kingdom to believing men

Ne com he to ðy þæt he wære on mærlicum cynesetle ahafen, ac þæt he wære mid hospe on rode hengene genæglod
He came not that he might be exalted on a pompous throne, but that he might with contumely be nailed hanging on a cross

He wolde ðeah þæs wælhreowan syrewunge mid fleame forbugan, na forði þæt he deað forfluge, seðe sylfwilles to ðrowienne middangearde genealæhte
Nevertheless, he would avoid the machination of the cruel tyrant by flight, not because he fled from death, who of his own will visited the world for the purpose of suffering

ac hit wære to hrædlic, gif he ða on cild-cradole acweald wurde, swilce ðonne his to-cyme mancynne bedíglod wære
but it would have been too early, if he had been slain in the child's cradle, for his advent would then, as it were, be hidden from mankind

þi forhradode Godes engel þæs arleasan geþeaht, and bebead þæt se foster-fæder þone heofenlican æþeling of ðam earde ardlice ferede
God's angel, therefore, prevented the impious counsel, and bade the foster-father convey the heavenly Prince forthwith from the country

Ne forseah Crist his geongan cempan, ðeah ðe he lichamlice on heora slege andwerd nære
Christ despised not his young champions, though he was not bodily present at their slaughter

ac hé asende hí fram þisum wræcfullum life to his ecan rice
but he sent them from this miserable life to his eternal kingdom

Gesælige hí wurdon geborene þæt hi moston for his intingan deað þrowian
Blessed they were born that they might for his sake suffer death

Eadig is heora yld, seoðe þa gyt ne mihte Crist andettan, and moste for Criste þrowian
Happy is their age, which could not yet acknowledge Christ, and might for Christ suffer

Hí wæron þæs Hælendes gewitan, ðeah ðe hí hine ða gyt ne cuðon
They were witnesses of Jesus, though they yet knew him not

Næron hí gerípode to slege, ac hi gesæliglice þeah swulton to life
They were not ripened for slaughter, yet they blessedly died to life

Gesælig wæs heora acennednys, forðan ðe hí gemetton þæt ece lif on instæpe þæs andweardan lifes
Blessed was their birth, because they found everlasting life at the entrance of this present life

Hí wurdon gegripene fram moderlicum breostum, ac hi wurdon betæhte þærrihte engellicum bosmum
They were snatched from their mothers' breasts, but they were instantly committed to the bosoms of angels

Ne mihte se mánfulla ehtere mid nanre ðenunge þam lytlingum swa micclum fremian, swa micclum swa hé him fremode mid ðære reðan ehtnysse hatunge
The wicked persecutor could not by any service so greatly favour those little ones, so greatly as he favoured them by the fierce hate of persecution

Hí sind gehátene martyra blostman, forðan ðe hí wæron swá swá up-aspringende blostman on middeweardan cyle ungeleaffulnysse, swilce mid sumere ehtnysse forste forsodene
They are called blossoms of martyrs, because they were as blossoms springing up in the midst of the chill of infidelity, consumed, as it were, by the frost of persecution

Eadige sind þa innoðas þe hí gebæron, and ða breost þe swylce gesihton
Blessed are the wombs which bare them, and the breasts that such have sucked

Witodlice ða moddru on heora cildra martyrdome þrowodon
Verily the mothers suffered through their children's martyrdom

þæt swurd ðe þæra cildra lima þurh-árn becóm to ðæra moddra heortan
the sword that pierced their children's limbs entered the hearts of the mothers, and it is needful that they be partakers of the eternal reward, when they were companions of the suffering

and neod is þæt hí beon efenhlyttan þæs ecan edleanes, þonne hí wæron geferan ðære ðrowunge
They were slain while little and witless, but they shall arise at the common doom in full growth, and with heavenly wisdom

Hí wæron gehwæde and ungewittige acwealde, ac hí arisað on þam gemænelicum dome mid fullum wæstme, and heofenlicere snoternysse
We shall all come to one age at the common resurrection, although we now in various age depart from this world

Þæt godspel cweð þæt Rachel beweóp hire cildra, and nolde beon gefrefrod, forðan þe hí ne sind
The gospel says, that Rachel wept for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not

Rachel hatte Iacobes wif, ðæs heahfæderes, and heo getacnode Godes gelaðunge, þe bewypð hire gastlican cild
Jacob the patriarch's wife was called Rachel, and she betokened God's church, which weeps for her ghostly children

ac heo nele swa beon gefrefrod, þæt hí eft to woruldlicum gecampe gehwyrfon, þa þe æne mid sygefæstum deaðe middangeard oferswiðdon, and his yrmða ætwundon to wuldorbeagienne mid Criste
but it will not so be comforted, that they again return to temporal strife, who once by a triumphant death have overcome the world, and escaped from its miseries to be crowned with glory with Christ

Eornostlice ne breac se arleasa Herodes his cynerices mid langsumere gesundfulnysse, ac buton yldinge him becom seo godcundlice wracu, þe hine mid menigfealdre yrmðe fordyde, and eac geswutelode on hwilcum suslum he moste æfter forðsiðe ecelice cwylmian
But the impious Herod did not enjoy his kingdom in long healthfulness, for without delay the divine vengeance came upon him, which afflicted him with manifold misery, and also manifested in what torments he must after death eternally suffer

Hine gelæhte unasecgendlic adl
An unspeakable disease seized him

his lichama barn wiðutan mid langsumere hætan, and he eal innan samod forswæled wæs, and toborsten
his body burned without with a lasting heat, and all within he was inflamed and bursten

Him wæs metes micel lust, ac ðeah mid nanum ætum his gyfernysse gefyllan ne mihte, He hriðode, and egeslice hweos, and angsumlice siccetunga teah, swa þæt hé earfoðlice orðian mihte
He had great craving for food, but yet with no viands could he satisfy his voracity, and fearfully rotted away, and dolefully fetched sighs, so that he could with difficulty breathe

Wæter-seocnyss hine ofereode, beneoðan þam gyrdle, to ðan swiðe, þæt his gesceapu maðan weollon, and stincende attor singallice of ðam toswollenum fotum fleow
Dropsy came on him, beneath the girdle, to that degree that his members swarmed with vermin, and stinking venom ever flowed from his swollen feet

Unaberendlic gyhða ofereode ealne ðone lichaman, and ungelyfendlic toblawennys his innoð geswencte
Unbearable palsies spread over his whole body, and incredible inflation afflicted his entrails

Him stód stíncende steam of ðam muðe, swa þæt earfoðlice ænig læce him mihte genealæcan
Stinking vapour proceeded from his mouth, so that hardly any leech could approach him

Fela ðæra læca hé acwealde, cwæð þæt hí hine gehælan mihton and noldon
Many of the leeches he slew, he said that they might heal him and would not

Hine gedrehte singal slæpleast, swa þæt he þurhwacole niht buton slæpe adreah
Constant sleeplessness afflicted him, so that he passed the whole night without sleep

and gif hé hwon hnáppode, ðærrihte hine drehton nihtlice gedwímor, swa þæt him ðæs slæpes ofþuhte
and if he dozed a little, nightly phantoms immediately tormented him, so that he repented of his sleep

Þaða hé mid swiðlicum luste his lifes gewilnode, þa hét hé hine ferigan ofer ða eá Iordanen, ðærþær wæron gehæfde háte baðu, þe wǽron halwende gecwedene adligendum lichaman
As he with violent longing desired his life, he commanded to be conveyed over the river Jordan, where there were hot baths, which were said to be salutary to diseased bodies

Wearð þa eac his læcum geðuht þæt hí on wlacum ele hine gebeðedon
It then seemed good to his leeches that they should bathe him in lukewarm oil

Ac ðaða hé wæs on ðissere beðunge geléd, þa wearð se lichama eal toslopen, swa þæt his eagan wendon on gelicnysse sweltendra manna, and hé læg cwydeleas butan andgite
But when he was led to this bathing, the body was all relaxed, so that his eyes turned to the likeness of dead men's, and he lay speechless, without sense

Eft ðaða he com, þa het he hine ferigan to ðære byrig Hiericho
When he came to, he commanded to be borne to the city of Jericho

Þaþa he wearð his lifes orwene, þa gelaðode he him to ealle ða Iudeiscan ealdras of gehwilcum burgum, and het hí on cwearterne beclysan, and gelangode him to his swustur Salome and hire wer Alexandrum, and cwæð
When he was hopeless of life he called to him all the Jewish elders from every city, and ordered them to be confined in prison, and sent for his sister Salome and her husband Alexander, and said

Ic wát þæt ðis Iudeisce folc micclum blissigan wile mines deaðes
I know that this Jewish people will greatly rejoice at my death

ac ic mæg habban arwurðfulle líc-ðenunge of heofigendre menigu, gif ge willað minum bebodum gehyrsumian
but I may have an honourable funeral attendance of a mourning multitude, if ye will obey my commands

Swa ricene swa ic gewíte, ofsleað ealle ðas Iudeiscan ealdras, ðe ic on cwearterne beclysde, þonne beoð heora siblingas to heofunge geneadode, þa ðe wyllað mines forðsiðes fagnian
As soon as I depart, slay all the Jewish elders whom I have confined in prison, then will their relations be compelled to mourn, who will rejoice at my departure

He ða his cempan to ðam slege genamode, and het heora ælcum fiftig scyllinga to sceatte syllan, þæt hi heora handa fram ðam blodes gyte ne wiðbrudon
He then appointed his soldiers to that slaughter, and commanded fifty shillings as reward to be given to each of them, that they might not withdraw their hands from the shedding of blood

Þaða hé mid ormætre angsumnysse wæs gecwylmed, þa het he his agenne sunu Antípatrem arleaslice acwellan, to-eacan þam twam þe hé ær acwealde
When he was tormented with intense agony he wickedly commanded his own son Antipater to be killed, in addition to the two whom he had killed previously

Æt nextan, ðaða hé gefredde his deaðes nealæcunge, þa het he him his seax aræcan to screadigenne ænne æppel, and hine sylfne hetelice ðyde, þæt him on acwehte
At last, when he was sensible of his death's approach, he commanded them to reach him his knife to shred an apple, and violently stabbed himself, so that it quaked in him

Þyllic wæs Herodes forðsið, þe mánfullice ymbe þæs heofenlican æþelinges to-cyme syrwde, and his efen-ealdan lytlingas unscæððige arleaslice acwealde
Such was the death of Herod, who wickedly machinated on the coming of the heavenly Prince, and impiously killed the innocent little ones, his equals in age

Efne ða Godes engel, æfter Herodes deaðe, æteowode Iosepe on swefnum, on Egypta lande, þus cweðende
Lo, then, God's angel, after the death of Herod, appeared to Joseph in a dream, in the land of Egypt, thus saying

Arís, and nim þæt cild and his moder samod, and gewend ongean to Israhela lande
Arise, and take the child together with his mother, and go again to the land of Israel

soðlice hí sind forðfarene, ðaðe ymbe þæs cildes feorh syrwdon
for they are dead, who machinated against the child's life

Hé ða arás, swa swa se engel him bebead, and ferode þæt cild mid þære meder to Israhela lande
He then arose, as the angel had commanded him, and conveyed the child with the mother to the land of Israel

Þa gefrán Ioseph þæt Archelaus rixode on Iudea lande, æfter his fæder Herode, and ne dorste his neawiste genealæcan
Then Joseph learned that Archelaus reigned in Judæa after Herod his father, and he durst not approach his presence

Þa wearð he eft on swefne gemynegod þæt he to Galilea gewende, forðan ðe se eard næs ealles swa gehende þam cyninge, þeah ðe hit his rice wære
Then again he was admonished in a dream that he should go to Galilee, because the country there was not quite so near to the king, though it was in his kingdom

Þæt cild ða eardode on þære byrig þe is gehaten Nazareth, þæt seo wítegung wære gefylled, þe cwæð, þæt he sceolde beon Nazarenisc geciged
The child then dwelt in the city which is called Nazareth, that the prophecy might be fulfilled, which said, that he should be called a Nazarene

Se engel cwæð to Iosepe
The angel said to Joseph

Þa sind forðfarene, þe embe ðæs cildes feorh syrwdon
They are dead who machinated against the child's life

Mid þam worde he geswutelode þæt má ðæra Iudeiscra ealdra embe Cristes cwale smeadon
With that word he manifested that more of the Jewish elders meditated the slaying of Christ

ac him getimode swiðe rihtlice þæt hí mid heora arleasan hlaforde ealle forwurdon
but it befell them very rightly, that they with their impious lord all perished

Nelle we ðas race na leng teon, þylæs ðe hit eow æðryt þince, ac biddað eow þingunge æt þysum unscæððigum martyrum
We will not longer extend this narrative, lest it may seem tedious to you, but will pray for the intercession of these innocent martyrs for you

Hi sind ða ðe Criste folgiað on hwitum gyrlum, swa hwider swa hé gæð
They are those who follow Christ in white garments, whithersoever he goeth

and hí standað ætforan his ðrymsetle, butan ælcere gewemmednysse, hæbbende heora palmtwigu on handa, and singað þone niwan lofsang, þam Ælmihtigan to wurðmynte, seþe leofað and rixað á butan ende
and they stand before his throne, without any impurity, having their palm-twigs in hand, and sing the new hymn in honour of the Almighty, who liveth and ruleth ever without end

Amen
Amen

Se Godspellere Lucas beleac þis dægþerlice godspel mid feawum wordum, ac hit is mid menigfealdre mihte þære heofenlican gerynu afylled
The evangelist Luke concluded the gospel of this day with few words, but they are filled with a manifold power of the heavenly mysteries

He cwæð
He said

Postquam consummati sunt dies octo ut circumcideretur puer, uocatum est nomen ejus Iesus, quod uocatum est ab angelo, priusquam in utero conciperetur
Postquam consummati sunt dies octo ut circumcideretur puer, vocatum est nomen ejus Jesus, quod vocatum est ab angelo, priusquam in utero conciperetur

Þæt is on ure geðeode
That is in our tongue

Æfter þan ðe wǽron gefyllede ehta dagas Drihtnes acennednysse þæt he ymbsniden wære, þa wæs his nama geciged Iesus, þæt is Hælend, ðam naman he wæs geháten fram ðam engle, ærðam þe hé on innoðe geeacnod wære
After that the eight days were accomplished from the Lord's birth, that he should be circumcised, his name was called Jesus, that is Saviour, by which name he was called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb

Abraham se heahfæder wæs ærest manna ymbsniden, be Godes hæse
The patriarch Abraham was the first man circumcised by God's command

Abraham wæs Godes gespreca, and God to him genam geþoftrædene æfter Noes flóde swiðost, and him to cwæð
Abraham spake with God, and God held converse most with him after Noah's flood, and said

Ic eom Ælmihtig Drihten
I am the Lord Almighty

gang beforan me, and beo fulfremed
walk before me and be perfect

And ic sette min wed betwux me and ðe, and ic ðe þearle gemenigfylde, and þu bist manegra þeoda fæder
And I will set my covenant betwixt me and thee, and I will exceedingly multiply thee, and thou shalt be the father of many nations

Cyningas aspringað of ðe, and ic sette min wed betwux me and ðe, and þinum ofspringe æfter ðe, þæt ic beo ðin God and ðines ofspringes
Kings shall spring from thee, and I will set my covenant betwixt me and thee, and thy offspring after thee, that I am the God of thee and of thy offspring

Abraham hine astrehte eallum limum to eorðan, and God him to cwæð
Abraham prostrated himself with all his limbs to the earth, and God said to him

Heald þu min wed, and þin ofspring æfter ðe on heora mægðum
Hold thou my covenant, and thy offspring after thee in their tribes

Ðis is min wed, þæt ge healdan sceolon betwux me and eow
This is my covenant, which ye shall hold betwixt me and you

þæt ælc hyse-cild on eowrum cynrene beo ymbsniden: þæt tácn sy betwux me and eow
that every male child in your tribe shall be circumcised: be that a sign betwixt me and you

Ælc hyse-cild, þonne hit eahta nihta eald bið, sy ymbsniden, ægðer ge æþelboren ge þeowetling
Let every male child, when it is eight nights old, be circumcised, both the noble-born and the slave

and seðe þis forgæið his sawul losað, forðan þe hé min wed aýdlode
and he who neglecteth this, his soul shall perish, because he hath disregarded my covenant

Ne beo ðu geciged heonon-forð Abram, ac Abraham, forðan þe ic gesette ðe manegra þeoda fæder
Now be thou henceforth called not Abram, but Abraham, because I will establish thee as the father of many nations

Ne ðin wif ne beo gehaten Saraí, ac beo gehaten Sarra
Nor be thy wife called Sarai, but be called Sarah

and ic hí gebletsige, and of hire ic ðe sylle sunu, þone ðu gecigest Isaac
and I will bless her, and of her I will give thee a son whom thou shalt call Isaac

and ic sette min wed to him and to his ofspringe on ecere fæstnunge
and I will set my covenant with him and his offspring for everlasting duration

And æfter ðære spræce se Ælmihtiga up gewende
And after this speech the Almighty went up

On þam ylcan dæge wæs Abraham ymbsniden, and eal his hyred, and syððan his sunu Isaac, on ðam eahtoðan dæge his acennednysse
On the same day Abraham was circumcised, and all his household, and afterwards his son Isaac, on the eighth day from his birth

Abrahames nama wæs æt fruman mid fif stafum gecweden, Abram, þæt is, 'Healic fæder'
Abraham's name was at first spoken with five letters, 'Abram,' that is High father

ac God geyhte his naman mid twam stafum, and gehet hine Abraham, þæt is, 'Manegra ðeoda fæder', forðan þe God cwæð, þæt he hine gesette manegum ðeodum to fæder
but God increased his name with two letters, and called him Abraham, that is Father of many nations: for God said that he had appointed him for father of many nations

Saraí wæs his wíf gehaten, þæt is gereht, 'Min ealdor,' ac God hi het syððan Sarra, þæt is, 'Ealdor,' þæt heo nære synderlice hire hiredes ealdor geciged, ac forðrihte 'Ealdor'
His wife was called Sarai, which is interpreted, My chief, but God called her afterwards Sarah, that is Chief, that she might not be exclusively called her family's chief, but absolutely chief

þæt is to understandenne ealra gelyfedra wifa moder
which is to be understood, mother of all believing women

Hund-teontig geara wæs Abraham, and his gebedda hund-nigontig, ærðan ðe him cild gemæne wære
An hundred years old was Abraham, and his consort ninety, before they had a child between them

Þaða him cild com, þa com hit mid Godes foresceawunge and bletsunge to þan swiðe, þæt God behet eallum mancynne bletsunge þurh his cynn
When a child came to them, it came so much with God's providence and blessing, that God promised blessing to all mankind through his kin

Ða heold Abrahames cynn symle syððan Godes wed
Then Abraham's kin ever held God's covenant

and se heretoga Moyses, and eal Israhela mægð ealle hi ymbsnidon heora cild on þam eahtoðan dæge, and him naman gesceopon, oð þæt Crist on menniscnysse acenned wearð, seðe fulluht astealde, and ðære ealdan ǽ getacnunge to gastlicere soðfæstnysse awende
and the leader Moses, and all the tribe of Israel, circumcised their children on the eighth day, and gave them names, until Christ was born in human nature, who established baptism, and changed the token of the old law to spiritual righteousness

Wén is þæt eower sum nyte hwæt sy ymbsnidennys
It is probable that some of you know not what circumcision is

God bebead Abrahame, þæt he sceolde and his ofspring his wed healdan
God commanded Abraham, that he and his offspring should hold his covenant

þæt sum tacn wære on heora lichaman to geswutelunge þæt hi on God belyfdon, and het þæt he náme scearpecgedne flint, and forcurfe sumne dæl þæs felles æt foreweardan his gesceape
that there might be some sign on their bodies to show that they believed in God, and commanded him to take a sharp-edged flint, and cut off a part of the foreskin

And þæt tacn wæs ða swa micel on geleaffullum mannum, swa micel swa nu is þæt halige fulluht, buton ðam anum þæt nan man ne mihte Godes rice gefaran, ærðan þe se come þe ða ealdan ǽ sette, and eft on his andwerdnysse hí to gastlicum þingum awende: ac gehwylce halgan andbidodon on Abrahames wununge buton tintregum, þeah on helle-wite, oðþæt se Alysend com, þe ðone ealdan deofol gewylde, and his gecorenan to heofenan rice gelædde
And that token was then as great among believing men as is now the holy baptism, excepting only that no man could go to God's kingdom, before He came who should confirm the old law, and afterwards, by his presence, turn it to a spiritual sense: but every holy man abode in Abraham's dwelling, without torments, although in hell, until the Redeemer came, who overcame the old devil, and led his chosen to the kingdom of heaven

Se ylca Hælend, þe nu egefullice and halwendlice clypað on his godspelle
The same Saviour, who now awfully and salutarily cries in his gospel

Buton gehwa beo ge-edcenned of wætere and of þam Halgum Gaste, ne mæg he faran into heofenan rice
Unless anyone be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot go to the kingdom of heaven

se ylca clypode gefyrn þurh ða ealdan ǽ
the same cried of old, through the old law

Swa hwylc hyse-cild swa ne bið ymbsniden on þam fylmene his flæsces his sawul losað, forðan þe he aydlode min wed
Whatever male child shall not be circumcised in the foreskin of his flesh, his soul shall perish, because he hath disregarded my covenant

Þis tacen stód on Godes folce oð þæt Crist sylf com, and he sylf wæs þære halgan ǽ underþeod þe he gesette, þæt he ða alysde þe neadwislice ðære ǽ underþeodde wæron
This sign stood among God's people until Christ himself came, and he himself was subject to the holy law that he had established, that he might release those who had necessarily been subjected to the old law

He cwæð þæt he ne cóme to ðy þæt he wolde þa ealdan ǽ towurpan, ac gefyllan
He said that he came not to overthrow, but to fulfil the old law

Þa wearð he on þam eahtoðan dæge his gebyrd-tide lichamlice ymbsniden, swa swa he sylf ær tæhte
Then on the eighth day from his birth he was bodily circumcised, as he himself had before taught, and thereby manifested that the old law was holy and good in its time for those who were obedient to it

and mid þam geswutelode þæt seo ealde ǽ wæs halig and gód on hire timan, þam ðe hire gehyrsume wæron
It was usual that the parents should give a name to the child on the eighth day, with circumcision, but they durst not give any other name to Christ than what the archangel had fixed on for him, before he was conceived in his mother's womb, that is, Jesus, and in our tongue, Saviour, because he shall save his people from their sins

Nis nu alyfed cristenum mannum þæt hi þas ymbsnidennysse lichamlice healdan, ac þeah-hwæðere nan man ne bið soðlice cristen, buton he ða ymbsnidennysse on gastlicum ðeawum gehealde
It is not now allowed to christian men to observe circumcision bodily, but, nevertheless, no man is truly a christian, unless he observe circumcision in spiritual conduct

Hwæt getacnað þæs fylmenes of-cyrf on ðam gesceape, buton galnysse wanunge
What does the amputation of the foreskin betoken but decrease of lust

Eaðe mihte þes cwyde beon læwedum mannum bediglod, nære seo gastlice getacning
This discourse might easily be concealed from the laymen, were it not for its spiritual signification

Hit ðincð ungelæredum mannum dyselig to gehyrenne
To unlearned men it seems foolish to hear

ac gif hit him dyslic þince, þonne cide he wið God, þe hit gesette, na wið us, þe hit secgað
but if it seems foolish to him, let him chide God, who established it, not us, who say it

Ac wite gehwa to gewissan, buton he his flæsclican lustas and galnysse gewanige, þæt he ne hylt his cristendóm mid rihtum biggenge
But let everyone know for certain, unless he diminish his fleshly lusts and wantonness, that he holds not his christianity with right observance

Be ðysum ðinge ge habbað oft gehyred, ac us is acumendlicere eower gebelh, þonne þæs Ælmihtigan Godes grama, gif we his bebodu forsuwiað
Of this matter ye have often heard, but to us your displeasure is more tolerable than the anger of Almighty God, if we announce not his commandments

Gif ge willað æfter menniscum gesceade lybban, þonne sind ge gastlice ymbsnidene
If ye will live according to human reason, then are ye spiritually circumcised

gif ge þonne eowere galnysse underþeodde beoð, þonne beo ge swa se witega cwæð
but if ye will be subjected to your libidinousness, then will ye be as the prophet said

Se mann ðaða he on wurðmynte wæs he hit ne understod
Man, when he was in dignity understood it not

he is forðy wiðmeten stuntum nytenum, and is him gelíc geworden
he is, therefore, compared with the foolish beasts, and is become like unto them

Forðy sealde God mannum gesceád, þæt hi sceoldon oncnawan heora Scyppend, and mid biggenge his beboda þæt ece lif geearnian
Therefore has God given reason to men that they might acknowledge their Creator, and by observance of his commandments, merit eternal life

Witodlice se fyrenfulla bið earmra ðonne ænig nyten, forðan þe þæt nyten næfð nane sawle, ne næfre ne ge-edcucað, ne þa toweardan wita ne ðrowað
Verily the wicked man is more miserable than any beast, because the beast has no soul, nor will ever be quickened again, nor suffer future punishments

Ac we ðe sind to Godes anlicnysse gesceapene, and habbað únateorigendlice saule, we sceolon of deaðe arísan, and agyldan Gode gescead ealra ura geðohta, and worda, and weorca
But we, who are created after God's likeness, and have an unperishable soul, we shall arise from death, and render to God an account of all our thoughts, and words, and works

Ne sceole we forðy sinderlice on anum lime beon ymbsnidene, ac we sceolon ða fulan galnysse symle wanian, and ure eagan fram yfelre gesihðe awendan, and earan from yfelre heorcnunge
Therefore we should not merely be circumcised in one member, but should constantly diminish foul libidinousness, and turn our eyes from evil seeing, and ears from evil hearing

urne múð fram leasum spræcum, handa fram mándædum
our mouth from leasing speeches, hand from wicked deeds

ure fotwylmas fram deadbærum siðfæte, ure heortan fram facne
our footsteps from the deadly path, our hearts from guile

Gif we swa fram leahtrum ymbsnidene beoð, þonne bið ús geset níwe nama, swa swa se wítega Isaías cwæð
If we are thus circumcised from sins, then will a new name be given us, as the prophet Isaiah said

God gecígð his ðeowan oðrum naman
God will call his servants by other names

Eft se ylca wítega cwæð
Again, the same prophet said

Þu bist gecíged niwum naman, þone ðe Godes múð genemnode
Thou shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of God hath named

Se níwa nama is 'Cristianus,' þæt is, Cristen
That new name is 'Christianus,' that is, Christian

Ealle we sind of Criste cristene gehátene, ac we sceolon ðone arwurðfullan naman mid æðelum þeawum geglengan, þæt we ne beon lease cristene
We are all from Christ called christians, but we should adorn that honourable name with exalted morals, that we be not false christians

Gif we ðas gastlican ymbsnidennysse on urum ðeawum healdað, þonne sind we Abrahames cynnes, æfter soðum geleafan
If we observe this spiritual circumcision in our morals, then are we of Abraham's kin, in true faith

swa swa se þeoda lareow Paulus cwæð to geleaffullum
as the apostle of the gentiles, Paul, said to the faithful

Gif ge sind Cristes, þonne sind ge Abrahames sǽd, and æfter behate yrfenuman
If ye are Christ's, then are ye of Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise

Petrus eac se apostol tihte geleaffulle wíf to eadmodnysse and gemetfæstnysse, ðus cweðende
Peter the apostle also exhorted faithful women to humility and modesty, thus saying

Swa swa Sarra gehyrsumode Abrahame, and hine hlaford het, ðære dohtra ge sind, wel donde and na ondrædende ænige gedrefednysse
As Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord, whose daughters ye are, well doing and not fearing any affliction

Se eahtoða dæg, þe þæt cild on ymbsniden wæs, getacnode ða eahtoðan ylde ðyssere worulde, on þære we arisað of deaðe ascyrede fram ælcere brosnunge and gewemmednysse ures lichaman
The eighth day, on which the child was circumcised, betokened the eighth age of this world, in which we shall arise from death, parted from every earthly corruption and pollution of our body

Þæt stænene sex, þe þæt cild ymbsnað, getacnode ðone stán ðe se apostol cwæð
The stone knife, which circumcised the child, betokened the stone of which the apostle said

Se stán soðlice wæs Crist
The stone verily was Christ

He cwæð wæs for ðære getacnunge, na for edwiste
He said was, meaning a type, not in substance

Þurh Cristes geleafan, and hiht, and soðe lufe, beoð singallice estfulle heortan mid dæghwonlicere ymbsnidenysse afeormode fram leahtrum, and ðurh his gife onlihte
Through belief, and hope, and true love of Christ, are pious hearts cleansed, by daily circumcision, from their sins, and through his grace enlightened

We habbað oft gehyred þæt men hatað þysne dæg geares dæg, swylce þes dæg fyrmest sy on geares ymbryne
We have often heard that men call this day the day of the year, as if this day were first in the circuit of the year

ac we ne gemetað nane geswutelunge on cristenum bocum, hwí þes dæg to geares anginne geteald sy
but we find no explanation in christian books, why this day is accounted the beginning of the year

Þa ealdan Romani, on hæðenum dagum, ongunnon þæs geares ymbryne on ðysum dæge
The old Romans, in heathen days, begun the circuit of the year on this day

and ða Ebreiscan leoda on lenctenlicere emnihte
and the Hebrew nations on the vernal equinox

ða Greciscan on sumerlicum sunstede
the Greeks on the summer solstice

and þa Egyptiscan ðeoda ongunnon heora geares getel on hærfeste
and the Egyptians begun their year at harvest

Nu onginð ure gerím, æfter Romaniscre gesetnysse, on ðysum dæge, for nanum godcundlicum gesceade, ac for ðam ealdan gewunan
Now our calendar begins, according to the Roman institution, on this day, not for any religious reason, but from old custom

Sume ure ðening-béc onginnað on Aduentum Domini
Some of our service-books begin on the Lord's Advent

nis ðeah þær forðy ðæs geares ord, ne eac on ðisum dæge nis mid nánum gesceade
but not on that account is that the beginning of the year, nor is it with any reason placed on this day

þeah ðe ure gerím-béc on þissere stówe ge-edlæcon
though our calendars, in this place, repeat it

Rihtlicost bið geðuht þæt þæs geares anginn on ðam dæge sy gehæfd, þe se Ælmihtiga Scyppend sunnan, and mónan, and steorran, and ealra tida anginn gesette
Most rightly it has been thought that the beginning of the year should be observed on the day that the Almighty Creator placed the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the beginning of all the seasons

þæt is on þam dæge þe þæt Ebreisce folc heora geares getel onginnað
that is on the day that the Hebrew people begin the calculation of their year

swa swa se heretoga Moyses on ðam ælicum bocum awrát
as the leader Moses has written in the books of laws

Witodlice God cwæð to Moysen be ðam monðe
Verily God said to Moses concerning that month

Þes monað is monða anginn, and he bið fyrmest on geares monðum
This month is the beginning of months, and it is first of the months of the year

Nu heold þæt Ebreisce folc ðone forman geares dæg on lenctenlicere emnihte, forðan ðe on ðam dæge wurdon gearlice tida gesette
Now the Hebrew people held the first day of the year on the vernal equinox, because on that day the yearly seasons were set

Se eahteteoða dæg þæs monðes þe we hátað Martius, ðone ge hatað Hlyda, wæs se forma dæg ðyssere worulde
The eighteenth day of the month that we call March, which ye call Hlyda, was the first day of this world

On ðam dæge worhte God leoht, and merigen, and æfen
On that day God made light, and morning, and evening

Ða eódon þry dagas forð buton tída gemetum
Then three days went forth without any measure of times

forðan þe tunglan næron gesceapene, ær on þam feorðan dæge
for the heavenly bodies were not created before the fourth day

On ðam feorðan dæge gesette se Ælmihtiga ealle tungla and gearlice tída, and hét þæt hí wǽron to tácne dagum and gearum
On the fourth day the Almighty fixed all the heavenly bodies, and the yearly seasons, and commanded that they should be for a sign, for days, and for years

Nu ongynnað þa Ebreiscan heora geares anginn on þam dæge þe ealle tida gesette wæron, þæt is on ðam feorðan dæge woruldlicere gesceapenysse, and se lareow Beda telð mid micclum gesceade þæt se dæg is XII KL, ðone dæg we freolsiað þam halgum were Benedick to wurðmynte, for his micclum geðincðum
Now the Hebrews begin their year on the day when all the seasons were appointed, that is on the fourth day of the world's creation, and the doctor Beda reckons, with great discretion, that that day is the twenty-first of March, the day which we celebrate in honour of the holy man Benedict, for his great excellencies

Hwæt eac seo eorðe cyð mid hire ciðum, þe ðonne ge-edcuciað, þæt se tima is þæt rihtlicoste geares anginn, ðe hí on gesceapene wæron
Aye, the earth also makes known by her plants, which then return to life, that the time at which they were created is the most correct beginning of the year

Nu wígliað stunte men menigfealde wígelunga on ðisum dæge, mid micclum gedwylde, æfter hæðenum gewunan, ongean heora cristendom, swylce hí magon heora líf gelengan, oþþe heora gesundfulnysse, mid þam ðe hí gremiað þone Ælmihtigan Scyppend
Now foolish men practise manifold divinations on this day, with great error, after heathen custom, against their christianity, as if they could prolong their life or their health, while they provoke the Almighty Creator

Sind eac manega mid swa micclum gedwylde befangene, þæt hí cepað be ðam monan heora fær, and heora dæda be dagum, and nellað heora ðing wanian on monan-dæg, for anginne ðære wucan
Many are also possessed with such great error, that they regulate their journeying by the moon, and their acts according to days, and will not undertake anything on Monday, because of the beginning of the week

ac se monan-dæg nis na fyrmest daga on þære wucan, ac is se oðer
though Monday is not the first day in the week, but is the second

Se sunnan-dæg is fyrmest on gesceapenysse and on endebyrdnysse, and on wurðmynte
Sunday is the first in creation, in order, and in dignity

Secgað eac sume gedwæsmenn þæt sum orfcyn sy þe man bletsigan ne sceole, and cweðað þæt hí þurh bletsunge misfarað, and ðurh wyrigunge geðeoð, and brucað þonne Godes gife him on teonan, buton bletsunge, mid deofles awyrigednysse
Some foolish men also say, that there are some kinds of animals which one should not bless, and say that they decline by blessing, and by cursing thrive, and so enjoy God's grace to their injury, without blessing, with the devil's malediction

Ælc bletsung is of Gode, and wyrigung of deofle}}
Every blessing is of God, and curse of the devil

God gesceop ealle gesceafta, and deofol nane gesceafta scyppan ne mæg, ac he is yfel tihtend, and leas wyrcend, synna ordfruma, and sawla bepæcend
God created all creatures, and the devil can create no creatures, for he is an inciter to evil, and worker of falsehood, author of sins, and deceiver of souls

Þa gesceafta ðe sind þwyrlice geðuhte, hí sind to wrace gesceapene yfel-dædum
The creatures that are thought monstrous have been created for punishment of evil deeds

Oft halige men wunedon on westene betwux reðum wulfum and leonum, betwux eallum deorcynne and wurmcynne, and him nan ðing derian ne mihte
Holy men often dwelt in the waste among fierce wolves and lions, among all the beast kind and the worm kind, and nothing might harm them

ac hí totæron þa hyrnedan næddran mid heora nacedum handum, and þa micclan dracan eaðelice acwealdon, buton ælcere dare, þurh Godes mihte
but they tore the horned serpents with their naked hands, and the great snakes they easily slew, without any hurt, through God's might

Wa ðam men þe brícð Godes gesceafta, buton his bletsunge, mid deofellicum wíglungum, þonne se ðeoda lareow cwæð, Paulus
Woe to the man who uses God's creatures, without his blessing, with diabolical charms, when the apostle of the gentiles, Paul, has said

Swa hwæt swa ge doð on worde, oððe on weorce, doð symle on Drihtnes naman, þancigende þam Ælmihtigan Fæder þurh his Bearn
Whatsoever ye do in word or in work, do always in the name of the Lord, thanking the Almighty Father through his Son

Nis þæs mannes cristendom naht, þe mid deoflicum wíglungum his líf adrihð
That man's christianity is naught, who passes his life in diabolical charms

he is gehíwod to cristenum men, and is earm hæðengylda
he is in appearance a christian man, and is a miserable heathen

swa swa se ylca apostol be swylcum cwæð
as the same apostle said of such

Ic wene þæt ic swunce on ydel, ðaða ic eow to Gode gebigde: nu ge cepað dagas and monðas mid ydelum wíglungum
I believe that I laboured in vain when I inclined you to God, now ye observe days and months with vain auguries

Is hwæðere æfter gecynde on gesceapennysse ælc lichamlice gesceaft ðe eorðe acenð fulre and mægenfæstre on fullum monan þonne on gewanedum
Every bodily creature in the creation which the earth produces, is, however, according to nature, fuller and stronger in full moon than in decrease

Swa eac treowa, gif hí beoð on fullum monan geheawene, hí beoð heardran and langfǽrran to getimbrunge, and swiðost, gif hí beoð unsæpige geworhte
Thus trees also, if they are felled in full moon, are harder and more lasting for building, and especially if they are made sapless

Nis ðis nan wíglung, ac is gecyndelic ðincg þurh gesceapenysse
This is no charm, but is a natural thing from their creation

Hwæt eac seo sǽ wunderlice geþwærlæcð þæs monan ymbrene
The sea too agrees wonderfully with the course of the moon

symle hí beoð geferan on wæstme and on wanunge
they are always companions in their increase and waning

And swa swa se mona dæghwonlice feower pricon lator arist, swa eac seo sǽ symle feower pricum lator fleowð
And as the moon rises daily four points later, so also the sea flows always four points later

Uton besettan urne hiht and ure gesælða on þæs Ælmihtigan Scyppendes foresceawunge, seðe ealle gesceafta on ðrim ðingum gesette, þæt is on gemete, and on getele, and on hefe
Let us set our hope and our happiness in the providence of the Almighty Creator, who hath placed all creatures in three things, that is in measure, and in number, and in weight

Sy him wuldor and lof á on ecnysse
Be to him glory and praise ever to eternity

Amen
Amen

Men ða leofostan, nu for feawum dagum we oferræddon þis godspel ætforan eow, þe belimpð to ðysses dæges ðenunge, for gereccednysse ðære godspellican endebyrdnysse
Most beloved men, a few days ago we read over this gospel before you, which belongs to the service of this day, for the interpretation of the evangelical narrative

ac we ne hrepodon þone traht na swiðor þonne to ðæs dæges wurðmynte belámp: nu wille we eft oferyrnan þa ylcan godspellican endebyrdnysse, and be ðyssere andweardan freolstíde trahtnian
but we did not touch on the exposition further than belonged to the dignity of that day: we will now again run over the same evangelical narrative, and expound it with regard to the present festival

Matheus se Godspellere cwæð
Matthew the Evangelist said

Cum natus esset Iesus in Bethleem Iudæ, in diebus Herodis regis, ecce Magi ab oriente uenerunt Hierosolimam, dicentes, Ubi est qui natus est Rex Iudeorum
Cum natus esset Jesus in Bethlehem Judæ, in diebus Herodis regis, ecce Magi ab oriente venerunt Hierosolymam, dicentes, Ubi est qui natus est Rex Judæorum

et reliqua
et reliqua

Þaða se Hælend acenned wæs on þære Iudeiscan Bethleem, on Herodes dagum cyninges, efne ða comon fram east-dæle middangeardes ðry tungel-witegan to ðære byrig Hierusalem, þus befrínende, Hwær is Iudeiscra leoda Cyning, seðe acenned is
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa, in the days of Herod the king, behold there came from the east part of the world three astrologers to the city of Jerusalem, thus inquiring, Where is the King of the Jews, who is born

etc
etc

Ðes dæg is gehaten Epiphania Domini, þæt is Godes geswutelung-dæg
This day is called the Epiphany of the Lord, that is the day of God's manifestation

On þysum dæge Crist wæs geswutelod þam ðrym cyningum, ðe fram east-dæle middangeardes hine mid þrimfealdum lacum gesohton
On this day Christ was manifested to the three kings, who, with threefold offerings, sought him from the eastern part of the world

Eft embe geara ymbrynum hé wearð on his fulluhte on þysum dæge middangearde geswutelod, ðaða se Halga Gást, on culfran híwe, uppon him gereste, and þæs Fæder stemn of heofenum hlúde swegde, þus cweðende
Again, after a course of years, he was, at his baptism, manifested to the world, when the Holy Ghost, in likeness of a dove, rested upon him, and the voice of the Father sounded loudly from heaven, thus saying

Þes is min leofa Sunu, þe me wél licað
This is my beloved Son who well pleaseth me

gehyrað him
obey him

Eac on ðisum dæge he awende wæter to æðelum wine, and mid þam geswutelode þæt he is se soða Scyppend, þe ða gesceafta awendan mihte
On this day also he turned water to noble wine, and thereby manifested that he is the true Creator who could change his creatures

For ðisum þrym ðingum is ðes freols-dæg Godes swutelung gecweden
For these three reasons this festival is called the Manifestation of God

On ðam forman dæge his gebyrd-tide he wearð æteowed þrym hyrdum on Iudeiscum earde, þurh ðæs engles bodunge
On the first day of his birth he was manifested to three shepherds in the Jewish country, through the announcement of the angel

On ðam ylcum dæge he wearð gecydd þam ðrym tungel-witegum on east-dæle, þurh ðone beorhtan steorran, ac on þysum dæge hí comon mid heora lacum
On the same day he was made known to the three astrologers in the East, through the bright star: for on this day they came with their offerings

Hit wæs gedafenlic þæt se gesceadwisa engel hine cydde þam gesceadwisum Iudeiscum, ðe Godes ǽ cuðon, and ðam haðenum, þe ðæs godcundan gesceades nyston na ðurh stemne, ac ðurh tacn wære geswutelod
It was fitting that the discreet angel should make him known to those discreet Jews, who knew God's law, and that he should be manifested to the heathens, who knew not the divine purpose, not through a voice, but by a sign

Þa Iudeiscan hyrdas getácnodon ða gastlican hyrdas, þæt sind ða apostolas, þe Crist geceas of Iudeiscum folce, ús to hyrdum and to lareowum
The Jewish shepherds betokened the spiritual shepherds, that is the apostles, whom Christ chose from the Jewish people, as shepherds for us and teachers

Ða tungel-witegan, ðe wæron on hæðenscipe wunigende, hæfdon getacnunge ealles hæðenes folces, ðe wurdon to Gode gebígede þurh ðæra apostola láre, þe wæron Iudeiscre ðeode
The astrologers, who were continuing in heathenism, betokened all heathen people who should be turned to God through the teaching of the apostles, who were of the Jewish nation

Soðlice se sealm-sceop awrát be Criste, þæt hé is se hyrn-stan þe gefegð þa twegen weallas togædere, forðan ðe he geþeodde his gecorenan of Iudeiscum folce and þa geleaffullan of hæðenum, swilce twegen wagas to anre gelaðunge
For the psalmist wrote concerning Christ, that he is the corner-stone which joins the two walls together, because he united his chosen of the Jewish people and the faithful of the heathen, as two walls, to one church

be ðam cwæð Paulus se apostol
concerning which Paul the apostle said

Se Hælend bodade on his to-cyme sibbe us ðe feorran wǽron, and sibbe þam ðe gehende wǽron
Jesus at his advent announced peace to us who were far off, and peace to those who were at hand

He is ure sibb, seðe dyde ægðer to anum, towurpende ða ǽrran feondscipas on him sylfum
He is our peace, who hath made both one, abolishing all our former enmities in himself

Þa Iudeiscan ðe on Crist gelyfdon wæron him gehéndor stówlice, and eac ðurh cyððe þære ealdan ǽ: we wæron swiðe fyrlyne, ægðer ge stówlice ge ðurh uncyððe
The Jews who believed in Christ were nearer to him locally, and also through knowledge of the old law: we were very remote, both locally and through ignorance

ac he us gegaderode mid ánum geleafan to ðam healicum hyrn-stane, þæt is to annysse his gelaðunge
but he gathered us with one faith to the high corner-stone, that is to the unity of his church

Ða easternan tungel-wítegan gesáwon níwne steorran beorhtne, na on heofenum betwux oðrum tunglum, ac wæs ángenga betwux heofenum and eorðan
The eastern astrologers saw a new bright star, not in heaven among other stars, but it was solitary between heaven and earth

Ða undergeaton hí þæt se seldcuða tungel gebicnode þæs soðan Cyninges acennednysse, on ðam earde ðe he oferglád
Then understood they that the wondrous star indicated the birth of the true King in the country over which it glided

and forði comon to Iudea rice, and þone arleasan cyning Herodem mid heora bodunge ðearle afǽrdon
and they therefore came to the kingdom of Juda, and greatly terrified the impious king Herod by their announcement

forðan ðe buton tweon seo eorðlice arleasnys wearð gescynd, þaða seo heofenlice healicnyss wearð geopenod
for earthly wickedness was without doubt confounded, when the heavenly greatness was disclosed

Swutol is þæt ða tungel-witegan tocneowon Crist soðne mann, ðaða hí befrunon
It is manifest that the astrologers knew Christ to be a true man, when they inquired

Hwær is se ðe acenned is
Where is he who is born

Hí oncneowon hine soðne Cyning, þaða hí cwædon
They knew him to be a true king, when they said

Iudea Cyning
King of Juda

Hí hine wurðodon soðne God, þaða hí cwædon
They worshipped him as true God, when they said

We comon to ðy þæt we us to him gebiddan
We come that we may adore him

Eaðe mihte God hí gewissian þurh ðone steorran to ðære byrig þe þæt cild on wæs, swa swa he his acennednysse þurh ðæs steorran up-spring geswutelode
Easily might God have directed them by the star to the city in which the child was, as he had manifested his birth by the rising of that star

ac he wolde þæt ða Iudeiscan boceras ða witegunge be ðam ræddon, and swa his cenning-stowe geswutelodon, þæt hí gehealdene wæron, gif hí woldon mid þan tungel-witegum hí to Criste gebiddan: gif hí þonne noldon, þæt hí wurdon mid þære geswutelunge geniðerode
but he would that the Jewish scribes should read the prophecy concerning him, and so manifest his birth-place, that they might be saved if, with the astrologers, they would worship Christ: but if they would not, that they might by that manifestation be condemned

Þa tungel-witegan ferdon and hí gebædon, and ða Iudeiscan boceras bæftan belifon, þe þa cenning-stowe þurh bóclic gescead gebícnodon
The astrologers went and worshipped, and the Jewish scribes remained behind, who had through book-knowledge pointed out the birth-place

Ealle gesceafta oncneowon heora Scyppendes to-cyme, buton ðam arleasum Iudeiscum anum
All creatures acknowledged their Creator's advent, save only the impious Jews

Heofonas oncneowon heora Scyppend, ðaða hí on his acennednysse níwne steorran æteowdon
The heavens acknowledged their Creator, when they at his nativity displayed a new star

Sǽ oncneow ðaða Crist mid drium fot-wylmum ofer hyre yða mihtelice eode
The sea acknowledged him, when Christ in his might with dry footsteps passed over its waves

Sunne oncneow, þaþa heo on his ðrowunge hire leoman fram mid-dæge oð nón behydde
The sun acknowledged him, when at his passion he hid his beams from mid-day till the ninth hour

Stanas oncneowon, ðaða hí on his forðsiðe sticmælum toburston
The stones acknowledged him, when at his death they burst in pieces

Seo eorðe oncneow, ðaða heo on his æriste eall byfode
The earth acknowledged him, when it all trembled at his resurrection

Hell oncneow, ðaða heo hire hæftlingas unðances forlet
Hell acknowledged him, when it unwillingly released its captives

And ðeah þa heard-heortan Iudei noldon for eallum ðam tacnum þone soðan Scyppend tocnáwan, þe þa dumban gesceafta undergeaton, and mid gebicnungum geswutolodon
And yet the hard-hearted Jews would not for all those signs acknowledge the true Creator, whom the dumb creation knew, and by tokens manifested

Næron hí swa-ðeah ealle endemes ungeleaffulle, ac of heora cynne wæron ægðer ge wítegan ge apostolas, and fela ðusenda gelyfedra manna
They were not, however, all equally unbelieving, but of their race there were both prophets and apostles, and many thousands of believing men

Þaþa ða tungel-witegan þone cyning gecyrdon, þa wearð se steorra him ungesewen
When the astrologers went to the king the star became invisible to them

and eft, ðaða hí to ðam cilde gecyrdon, þa gesawon hí eft ðone steorran, and he ða hí gelædde to þam huse, þær hé inne wunode
and afterwards, when they went to the child, they again saw the star, which then led them to the house in which he was staying

Ne glad hé ealne weig him ætforan, ac syððan hí comon to Iudeiscum earde, syððan he wæs heora latteow, oð þæt he bufan Cristes gesthuse ætstod
It did not glide before them all the way, but after they came to the Jewish country it was their guide until it stopt above Christ's inn

Herodes hæfde deofles getacnunge
Herod betokens the devil

and se ðe fram Gode bichð to deofle he forlyst Godes gife, þæt is his modes onlihtinge, swa swa ða tungel-witegan ðone steorran forluron, ðaða hí ðone reðan cyning gecyrdon
and he who inclines from God to the devil loses God's grace, that is the enlightening of his understanding, as the astrologers lost the star when they went to the cruel king

Gif he ðonne eft þone deofol anrædlice forlǽt, ðonne gemét hé eft þæs halgan Gastes gife, þe his heortan onliht, and to Criste gelæt
But if he afterwards resolutely forsake the devil, then will he again have found the grace of the Holy Ghost, which enlightens his heart and leads to Christ

Us is eac to witenne, þæt wæron sume gedwolmen ðe cwǽdon, þæt ælc man beo acenned be steorrena gesetnyssum, and þurh heora ymbryna him wyrd gelimpe, and námon to fultume heora gedwylde þæt níwe steorra asprang þaþa Drihten lichamlice acenned wearð, and cwædon þæt se steorra his gewyrd wære
We are also to know, that there were some heretics who said, that every man is born according to the position of the stars, and that by their course his destiny befalls him, and advanced in support of their error, that a new star sprang up when the Lord was corporally born, and said that that star was his destiny

Gewíte ðis gedwyld fram geleaffullum heortum, þæt ænig gewyrd sy, buton se Ælmihtiga Scyppend, seðe ælcum men foresceawað lif be his geearnungum
Let this error depart from believing hearts, that there is any destiny excepting the Almighty Creator, who provides for every man life by his merits

Nis se man for steorrum gesceapen, ac ða steorran sint mannum to nihtlicere lihtinge gesceapene
Man is not created for the stars, but the stars are created as a light by night for men

Þaða se steorra glád, and þa tungel-witegan gelædde, and him ðæs cildes inn gebícnode, ða geswutelode he þæt he wæs Cristes gesceaft, and rihtlice his Scyppende þenode: ac hé næs his gewyrd
When the star glided, and led the astrologers, and pointed out to them the Child's inn, it showed that it was Christ's creature, and rightly ministered to its Creator: but it was not his destiny

Eft we biddað þæt nán geleafful man his geleafan mid þisum gedwylde ne befyle
Again we beseech that no believing man defile his faith with this error

Witodlice Rebecca, Isaáces wíf, acende twegen getwysan, Iacob and Esau, on ánre tide, swa þæt Iacob heold þone yldran broðer Esau be ðam fét on ðære cenninge, and hi næron ðeah gelice on ðeawum, ne on lifes geearnungum
Verily Rebekah, Isaac's wife, brought forth twins, Jacob and Esau, at one time, so that Jacob held his elder brother Esau by the foot at his birth, yet were they not alike in character, nor in the actions of their life

Witodlice þæt halige gewrit cwyð þæt God lufode Iacob, and hatode Esau
Holy writ indeed says that God loved Jacob, and hated Esau

na for gewyrde, ac for mislicum geearnungum
not by destiny, but for various acts

Hit gelimpð forwel oft þæt on anre tíde acenð seo cwén and seo wyln, and ðeah geðicð se æðeling be his gebyrdum to healicum cynesetle, and ðære wylne sunu wunað eal his líf on ðeowte
It happens very often that the queen and the slave bring forth at one time, and yet the prince, through his birth, grows up for the lofty throne, and the son of the slave continues all his life in servitude

Nu cweðað oft stunte men þæt hi be gewyrde lybban sceolon, swylce God hí neadige to yfel-dædum
Now foolish men often say that they must live according to destiny, as if God compels them to evil deeds

Ac we wyllað þyssera stuntra manna ydele leasunge adwæscan mid deopnysse godcundra gewrita
But we will overthrow the idle leasing of these foolish men with the deepness of the divine writings

Se Ælmihtiga Scyppend gesceop englas þurh his godcundan mihte, and for his micclan rihtwisnysse forgeaf him agenne cyre, þæt hí moston ðurhwunian on ecere gesælðe ðurh gehyrsumnysse, and mihton eac ða gesælða forleosan, na for gewyrde, ac for ungehyrsumnysse
The Almighty Creator created angels by his divine power, and in his great righteousness gave them their own choice, that they might continue in eternal happiness through obedience, and might also lose that happiness, not through destiny, but for disobedience

His deope rihtwisnys nolde hí neadian to naðrum, ac forgeaf him agenne cyre
His great righteousness would not compel them to either, but gave them their own choice

forðan ðe þæt is rihtwisnys þæt gehwylcum sy his agen cyre geðafod
for that is righteousness, that to every one be allowed his own choice

Þonne wære seo rihtwisnys awǽged, gif he hí neadunge to his ðeowte gebigde, oððe gif he hí to yfelnysse bescufe
For his righteousness would be rendered vain, if he forcibly subjected them to his service, or if he impelled them to evil

Ða miswendon sume þa englas heora agenne cyre, and þurh modignysse hy sylfe to awyrigedum deoflum geworhton
Then some angels abused their own choice, and through pride transformed themselves to accursed devils

Eft ðaða se ðrimwealdenda Scyppend mancyn geworhte, þa forgeaf hé Adame and Euan agenne cyre, swa hi, ðurh gehyrsumnysse, á on ecnysse, butan deaðe, on gesælðe wunodon, mid eallum heora ofspringe, swa hi, ðurh ungehyrsumnysse, deadlice wurdon
Again, when the glorious Creator made mankind, he gave to Adam and Eve their own choice, whether they, through obedience, would for ever, without death, continue in happiness, with all their offspring, or whether, through disobedience, they would become mortal

Ac ðaþa hí Godes bebod forgægdon, and þæs awyrigedan deofles lare gehyrsumodon, þa wurdon hi deadlice, and forscyldegode þurh agenne cyre, hí and eall heora ofspring
But when they transgressed God's command, and obeyed the instruction of the accursed devil, then they became mortal, and guilty through their own choice, they and all their offspring

and ðeah ðe næfre ne wurde syððan mancynne gemiltsod, ðe má ðe ðam deoflum is, ðeah wære Godes rihtwisnys eallunga untæle
and although mercy should never after be shown to mankind, more than to the devils, nevertheless, the righteousness would be infinite

Ac eft seo miccle mildheortnys ures Drihtnes us alysde þurh his menniscnysse, gif we his bebodum mid ealre heortan gehyrsumiað
But the great mercy of our Lord hath redeemed us through his humanity, if we with all our heart will obey his commandments

Witodlice ða ðe nu þurh agenne cyre and deofles tihtinge God forlætað, God forlæt hí eac to ðam ecan forwyrde
Verily those who now, through their own choice, and the devil's instigation, forsake God, God will abandon them also to eternal perdition

Georne wiste se Ælmihtiga Scyppend, ærðan þe he þa gesceafta gesceope, hwæt toweard wæs
The Almighty Father well knew, before he created his creatures, what was to come to pass

He cuðe gewislice getel ægðer ge gecorenra engla ge gecorenra manna, and eac ðæra modigra gasta and arleasra manna, þe ðurh heora arleasnysse forwurðað
He knew with certainty the number both of chosen angels and of chosen men, and also of the haughty spirits and impious men, who through their impiety perish

ac he ne forestihte nænne to yfelnysse, forðan þe he sylf is eall gódnyss
But he predestined no one to evil, for he himself is all goodness

ne hé nænne to forwyrde ne gestihte, forðan ðe he is soð líf
nor destined he any one to perdition, for he is true life

He forestihte ða gecorenan to ðam ecan life, forðan ðe he wiste hí swilce towearde, þurh his gife and agene gehyrsumnysse
He predestined the elect for eternal life, because he knew that they would be such, through his grace and their own obedience

He nolde forestihtan þa arleasan to his rice, forðan ðe he wiste hí swilce towearde, þurh heora agene forgægednysse and ðwyrnysse
He would not predestine the wicked to his kingdom, because he knew that they would be such, through their own transgression and perversity

Healdað þis fæste on eowerum heortum, þæt se Ælmihtiga and se Rihtwisa God nænne mann ne neadað to syngigenne, ac he wát swa-ðeah on ǽr hwilce þurh agenne willan syngian willað
Hold this fast in your hearts, that the Almighty and the Righteous God compels no man to sin, but he knows, nevertheless, beforehand who will sin through their own will

Hwí ne sceal he ðonne rihtlice wrecan þæt yfel þæt he onscunað
Why then shall he not justly avenge that evil which he abominates

He lufað ælc gód and rihtwisnysse, forðan ðe he is gecyndelice gód and rihtwis
He loves every good and righteousness, for he is by nature good and righteous

and he hatað ealle ða ðe unrihtwisnysse wyrcað, and þa fordeð þe leasunge sprecað
and he hates all those who work unrighteousness, and fordoes those who speak leasing

Witodlice þa þe on God belyfað, hi sind þurh ðone Halgan Gást gewissode
Verily those who believe in God are directed by the Holy Ghost

Nis seo gecyrrednys to Gode of us sylfum, ac of Godes gife, swa swa se apostol cwyð
The turning to God is not of ourselves, but by God's grace, as the apostle says

Þurh Godes gife ge sind gehealdene on geleafan
Through God's grace we are held in faith

Þa ðe ne gelyfað ðurh agenne cyre hí scoriað, na ðurh gewyrd, forðan ðe gewyrd nis nan ðing buton leas wena
Those who believe not through their own choice perish, not through destiny, for destiny is nothing but a false imagination

ne nan ðing soðlice be gewyrde ne gewyrð, ac ealle ðing þurh Godes dom beoð geendebyrde, seðe cwæð þurh his witegan
for nothing takes place by destiny, but all things are ordered by the doom of God, who said through his prophet

Ic afandige manna heortan, and heora lendena, and ælcum sylle æfter his færelde, and æfter his agenre afundennysse
I try the hearts of men, and their loins, and give to everyone according to his course, and according to his own invention

Ne talige nan man his yfelan dæda to Gode, ac talige ærest to þam deofle, þe mancyn beswác, and to Adámes forgægednysse
Let no man ascribe his evil deeds to God, but ascribe them first to the devil, who deceived mankind, and to Adam's transgression

ac ðeah swiðost to him sylfum, þæt him yfel gelicað, and ne licað gód
but above all to himself, that evil pleases him and good pleases him not

Bið þeah gelome ofsprincg forscyldegod þurh forðfædera mándæda, gif he mid yfele him geefenlæhð
It often, however, happens that the offspring are condemned through the wicked deeds of their forefathers, if they imitate them in evil

Gif ðonne se ofspring rihtwis bið, þonne leofað he on his rihtwisnysse, and nateshwon his yldrena synna ne aberð
But if the offspring are righteous, then will they live in their righteousness, and will not in the least bear their parents' sins

Ne sy nán man to ðan arleas þæt hé Adam wyrige oððe Euan, ðe nu on heofenum mid Gode rixiað, ac geearnige swiðor Godes mildheortnysse, swa þæt hé wende his agenne cyre to his Scyppendes gehyrsumnysse and bebodum
Let no man be so impious that he curse Adam or Eve, who now reign with God in heaven, but let him rather merit God's mercy, so that he turn his own choice to the obedience and commandments of his Creator

forðan þe nan man ne bið gehealden buton þurh gife Hælendes Cristes: þa gife he gearcode and forestihte on ecum ræde ær middangeardes gesetnysse
for no man will be saved, but through the grace of Jesus Christ: that grace he prepared and preordained to last for ever, before the foundation of the world

Mine gebroðra, ge habbað nu gehyred be ðan leasan wenan, þe ydele men gewyrd hatað: uton nu fón on þæs godspelles trahtnunge, þær we hit ær forleton
My brothers, ye have now heard concerning the false imagination, which vain men call destiny: let us now resume the exposition of the gospel, where we previously left it

Þa tungel-witegan eodon into ðæs cildes gesthuse, and hine gemetton mid þære meder
The astrologers went into the child's inn, and found him with his mother

Hí ða mid astrehtum lichaman hi to Criste gebædon, and geopenodon heora hordfatu, and him geoffrodon þryfealde lác, gold, and recels, and myrran
They then, with outstretched bodies, worshipped Christ, and opened their coffers, and offered to him threefold gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh

Gold gedafenað cyninge
Gold befits a king

stór gebyrað to Godes ðenunge
frankincense belongs to God's service

mid myrran man behwyrfð deadra manna líc, þæt hí late rotian
with myrrh the corpses of the dead are prepared that they may not soon rot

Ðas ðrý tungel-wítegan hí to Criste gebǽdon, and him getacnigendlice lac offrodon
These three astrologers worshipped Christ, and offered to him significant gifts

Þæt gold getacnode þæt he is soð Cyning
The gold betokened that he is a true King

Se stór þæt he is soð God
The frankincense that he is true God

Seo myrre þæt he wæs ða deadlic
The myrrh that he was then mortal

ac he þurhwunað nu undeadlic on ecnysse
but he now continues immortal to eternity

Sume gedwolmen wæron þe gelyfdon þæt hé God wære, ac hi nateshwón ne gelyfdon þæt hé æghwær rixode: hi offrodon Criste gastlice recels, and noldon him gold offrian
There were some heretics who believed that he was God, but they in no wise believed that he anywhere reigned: they offered frankincense to Christ spiritually, and would not offer him gold

Eft wæron oðre gedwolmen ðe gelyfdon þæt he soð Cyning wære, ac hi wiðsocon þæt he God wære: ðas, buton twyn, him offrodon gold, and noldon offrian recels
Again, there were other heretics who believed that he was a true King, but they denied that he was God: these, without doubt, offered gold to him, and would not offer frankincense

Sume gedwolan andetton þæt he soð God wære and soð Cyning, and wiðsocon þæt hé deadlic flæsc underfenge: þas witodlice him brohton gold and stór, and noldon bringan myrran þære onfangenre deadlicnysse
Some heretics acknowledged that he was true God and true King, and denied that he assumed mortal flesh: these brought him gold and frankincense, and would not bring the myrrh of the assumed mortality

Mine gebroðra, uton we geoffrian urum Drihtne gold, þæt we andettan þæt hé soð Cyning sy, and æghwær rixige
My brothers, let us offer to our Lord gold in acknowledgment that he is a true King, and rules everywhere

Uton him offrian stór, þæt we gelyfon þæt hé ǽfre God wæs, seðe on þære tide man æteowde
Let us offer to him frankincense, because we believe that he ever was God, who at that time appeared man

Uton him bringan myrran, þæt we gelyfan þæt he wæs deadlic on urum flæsce, seðe is unðrowigendlic on his godcundnysse
Let us bring him myrrh, because we believe that he was mortal in our flesh, who is impassible in his divine nature

He wæs deadlic on menniscnysse ær his ðrowunge, ac he bið heonon-forð undeadlic, swa swa we ealle beoð æfter ðam gemænelicum æriste
He was mortal in human nature before his passion, but he is henceforth immortal, as we all shall be after the universal resurrection

We habbað gesǽd embe ðas þryfealdan lac, hú hí to Criste belimpað: we willað eac secgan hú hí to ús belimpað æfter ðeawlicum andgite
We have said concerning these threefold gifts, how they apply to Christ: we wish also to say how they, in a moral sense, apply to us

Mid golde witodlice bið wisdom getácnod, swa swa Salomon cwæð
By gold is wisdom betokened, as Solomon said

Gewilnigendlic gold-hord lið on ðæs witan muðe
A desirable gold-treasure lieth in the wise man's mouth

Mid store bið geswutelod halig gebed, be ðam sang se sealm-scop
With frankincense is manifested holy prayer, concerning which the psalmist sang

Drihten, sy min gebed asend swa swa byrnende stór on ðinre gesihðe
Lord, be my prayer sent forth like burning frankincense in thy sight

Þurh myrran is gehíwod cwelmbærnys ures flæsce, be ðam cweð seo halige gelaðung
By myrrh is typified the mortality of our flesh, concerning which the holy congregation says

Mine handa drypton myrran
My hands dropt myrrh

Þam acennedan Cyninge we bringað gold, gif we on his gesihðe mid beorhtnysse þæs upplican wisdomes scinende beoð
To the born King we bring gold, if we are shining in his sight with the brightness of heavenly wisdom

Stór we him bringað, gif we ure geðohtas ðurh gecnyrdnysse haligra gebeda on weofode ure heortan onǽlað, þæt we magon hwæthwega wynsumlice ðurh heofenlice gewilnunge stincan
Frankincense we bring him, if we, by diligence of holy prayers, kindle our thoughts on the altar of our heart, so that we may, through heavenly desire, give forth a sweetish savour

Myrran we him offriað, gif we ða flæsclican lustas þurh forhæfednysse cwylmiað
Myrrh we offer him, if through continence we quell the lusts of the flesh

Myrra deð, swa we ær cwædon, þæt þæt deade flæsc eaðelice ne rotað
Myrrh, as we have before said, acts so that dead flesh does not easily rot

Witodlice þæt deade flæsc rotað leahtorlice, þonne se deadlica lichama ðeowað þære flowendan galnysse, swa swa se wítega be sumum cwæð
Verily the dead flesh rots flagitiously, when the mortal body is subservient to overflowing lust, as the prophet said by one

Ða nytenu forrotedon on heora meoxe
The beasts rotted in their dung

Þonne forrotiað þa nytenu on heora meoxe, þonne flæsclice men on stence heora galnysse geendiað heora dagas
Then the beasts rot in their dung, when fleshly men end their days in the stench of their lust

Ac gif we ða myrran Gode gastlice geoffriað, þonne bið ure deadlica lichama fram galnysse stencum ðurh forhæfednysse gehealden
But if we offer myrrh to God spiritually, then will our mortal body be preserved through continence from the stenches of lust

Sum ðing miccles gebícnodon þa tungel-witegan us mid þam þæt hi ðurh oðerne weg to heora earde gecyrdon
The astrologers pointed out to us something great by returning another way to their country

Ure eard soðlice is neorxna-wang, to ðam we ne magon gecyrran þæs weges ðe we comon
For our country is Paradise, to which we cannot return by the way we came

Se frumsceapena man and eall his ofspring wearð adræfed of neorxena-wanges myrhðe, þurh ungehyrsumnysse, and for ðigene þæs forbodenan bigleofan, and ðurh modignysse, ðaða he wolde beon betera ðonne hine se Ælmihtiga Scyppend gesceop
The first-created man and all his offspring were driven from the joy of Paradise, through disobedience, and for eating the forbidden food, and through pride, when he would be better than the Almighty Creator had created him

Ac us is micel neod þæt we ðurh oðerne weg þone swicolan deofol forbugan, þæt we moton gesæliglice to urum eðele becuman, þe we to gesceapene wæron
But it is greatly needful to us that we should, by another way, avoid the treacherous devil, that we may happily come to our country, for which we were created

We sceolon þurh gehyrsumnysse, and forhæfednysse, and eadmodnysse, ánmodlice to urum eðele stæppan, and mid halgum mægnum ðone eard ofgan, þe we ðurh leahtras forluron
We should, by obedience, and continence, and humility, unanimously proceed to our home, and with holy virtues require the country, which we lost through sins

Rihtlice wæs se swicola Herodes fram þam tungel-witegum bepæht, and he to Criste ne becom, forðan ðe hé mid facenfullum mode hine sohte
Rightly was the treacherous Herod deceived by the astrologers, and came not to Christ, because he sought him with a guileful purpose

He getacnode þa leasan licceteras, ðe mid híwunge God secað, and næfre ne gemetað
He betokened the false hypocrites, who in outward show seek God, and never find him

He is to secenne mid soðfæstre heortan, and anrædum mode, seðe leofað and rixað mid Fæder and Halgum Gaste, on ealra worulda woruld
He is to be sought with a true heart, and steadfast mind, who liveth and ruleth with the Father and the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever

Amen
Amen

Matheus, se eadiga Godspellere awrát on þissere godspellican rædinge, þæt
Matthew, the blessed Evangelist, wrote in this evangelical lecture, that

se Hælend niðer-eode of anre dune, and him filigde micel menigu
Jesus came down from a mountain, and a great multitude followed him

Efne ða com sum hreoflig mann, and aleat wið þæs Hælendes, þus cweðende, Drihten, gif þu wilt, þu miht me geclænsian
Behold, there came a leprous man, and fell down before Jesus, thus saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me

Se Hælend astrehte his hand, and hine hrepode, and cwæð, Ic wylle
Jesus stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and said, I will

and sy ðu geclænsod
and be thou cleansed

Þa sona wearð his hreofla eal geclænsod, and he wæs gehæled
Then immediately was his leprosy all cleansed, and he was healed

Ða cwæð se Hælend him to, Warna þæt þu hit nanum menn ne secge
Then said Jesus to him, Take care that thou say it to no man

ac far to Godes temple, and geswutela ðe sylfne ðam sacerde, and geoffra ðine lác, swá swá Moyses bebead him on gewitnysse
but go to God's temple, and show thyself to the priest, and offer thy gift, as Moses commanded for a witness to them

Se láreow Hægmon cweð on ðissere trahtnunge þæt seo dún þe se Hælend of-astah getacnode heofenan rice, of ðam niðer-astah se Ælmihtiga Godes Sunu, ðaða he underfeng ure gecynd, and to menniscum men geflæschamod wearð, to ðy þæt he mancynn fram deofles anwealde alysde
The doctor Haymo says in exposition of this, that the mountain from which Jesus descended betokened the kingdom of heaven, from which the Almighty Son of God came down, when he assumed our nature, and became incarnate as a human being, in order that he might redeem mankind from the power of the devil

He wæs ungesewenlic and unðrowigendlic on his gecynde
He was invisible and impassible in his nature

þa wearð he gesewenlic on urum gecynde, and þrowigendlic
then he became visible in our nature, and passible

Seo micele menigu ðe him filigde getacnode ða geleaffullan cristenan, þe mid heora þeawa stæpum Drihtne filiað
The great multitude which followed him betokened those faithful christians, who follow the Lord with the steps of their moral virtues

Witodlice we folgiað Cristes fotswaðum, gif we his gebisnungum mid godum weorcum geefenlæcað
Verily we follow Christ's foot-traces, if, with good works, we imitate his examples

Efne ða com sum hreoflig man, and aleat wið þæs Hælendes, þus cweðende, Drihten, gif þu wilt, ðu miht me geclænsian
Behold, there came a leprous man, and fell down before Jesus, thus saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me

Se Hælend astrehte his hand, and hine hrepode, and cwæð, Ic wille
Jesus stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and said, I will

and sy ðu geclænsod
and be thou cleansed

Þa sona wearð his hreofla eal geclænsod, and he wæs gehæled
Then immediately was his leprosy all cleansed, and he was healed

On ðissere dæde is geswutelod Godes miht, and his eadmodnys
In this deed is manifested God's might, and his humility

Moyses ǽ forbead to hrepenne ænigne hreoflan, ac se eadmoda Crist nolde hine forseon, þeah ðe he atelic wære, and eac geswutelode þæt hé wæs Hlaford þære ealdan ǽ, and na ðeow
The law of Moses forbade to touch any leper, but the humble Christ would not despise him, though he was loathsome, and also manifested that he was lord of the old law, and not its slave

Mihtiglice he mihte mid his worde hine gehælan, buton hrepunge
In his might he could have healed him with his word, without touching

ac he geswutelode þæt his hrepung is swiðe halwende geleaffullum
but he manifested that his touch is very salutary to believers

Geleafful wæs se hreoflia, ðaða he cwæð
The leper was a believer, when he cried

Drihten, gif þu wilt, ðu miht me geclænsian
Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me

Se Hælend andwyrde
Jesus answered

Ic wylle
I will

and þu beo geclænsod
and be thou cleansed

Godes hæs soðlice is weorc, swa swa se sealm-wyrhta cwæð
Verily God's behest is act, as the psalmist said

He hit gecwæð, and þa gesceafta wæron geworhte
He said it, and creatures were made

He bebead, and hí wæron gesceapene
He commanded, and they were created

On gastlicum andgite getacnode þes hreoflia man eal mancyn, þe wæs atelice hreoflig, mid mislicum leahtrum on þam inran menn
In a spiritual sense this leper betokened all mankind, which was foully leprous with divers sins in the inward man

ac hit gebeah to Cristes geleafan, and gleawlice undergeat þæt hit ne mihte þære sawle clænsunge onfon, buton þurh Drihten, þe nane synne ne worhte, ne nan facn næs on his muðe gemet
but it inclined to the belief of Christ, and wisely conceived that it could not receive a cleansing of the soul, save through the Lord, who wrought no sin, nor was any guile found in his mouth

Laðlic bið þæs hreoflian lic mid menigfealdum springum and geswelle, and mid mislicum fagnyssum
Loathsome is the body of the leper with many ulcers and tumours, and with divers scabs

ac se inra mann, þæt is seo sawul, bið micele atelicor, gif heo mid mislicum leahtrum begripen bið
but the inward man, that is the soul, is much more loathsome, if it be seized with divers sins

We sceolon rihtlice gelyfan on Crist, þæt he ure sawle fram synna fagnyssum gehælan mæge
We should rightly believe in Christ, that he may heal our soul from the ulcers of sins

and we sceolon anrædlice his willan to ðære fremminge biddan
and we should steadfastly implore his will to that fulfilment

His hand getacnað his mihte and his flæsclicnysse
His hand betokens his might and his incarnation

Swa swa Crist mid his handa hrepunge þone hreoflian gehælde, swa eac he alysde us fram ure sawla synnum ðurh anfenge ures flæsces
As Christ by the touch of his hands healed the leper, so also he redeemed us from the sins of our souls by the assumption of our flesh

swa swa se witega Isaias cwæð
as the prophet Isaiah said

Soðlice he sylf ætbræd ure adlunga, and ure sarnyssa he sylf abær
Verily he took away our diseases, and our pains he himself bare

Mid þam ðe he forbead þam gehæledum hreoflian þæt he hit nanum men ne cydde, mid þam he sealde us bysne þæt we ne sceolon na wídmærsian ure wel-dæda, ac we sceolon onscunian, mid inweardre heortan, þone ydelan gylp, gif we hwæt lytles to góde gedoð
When he forbade the healed leper not to make it known to any man, he thereby gave us an example that we should not publish our good deeds, but we should shun, with inward heart, vain pride, if we do some little good

Witodlice ne bið us mid nanum oðrum edleane forgolden, gif we goód for gylpe doð, buton mid helle susle
Verily we shall be requited with no other reward, if we do good for pride, than with hell-torment

forðan ðe gilp is an heofod-leahter
because pride is a deadly sin

Seo ealde ǽ bebead þæt gehwilc hreoflig man gecome to þam sacerde, and se sacerd sceolde hine fram mannum ascirian, gif hé soðlice hreoflig wære
The old law commanded that every leper should go to the priest, and that the priest should separate him from men, if he really were leprous

Gif he nære swutelice hreoflig, wære ðonne be his dome clæne geteald
If he were not manifestly leprous, he should then, by his judgement, be accounted clean

Gif se sacerd hine hreofligne tealde, and Godes miht hine syððan gehælde, þonne sceolde he mid lace his clænsunge Gode ðancian
If the priest accounted him leprous, and God's might afterwards healed him, that he should then, with a gift, thank God for his cleansing

Swa sceal eac se ðe mid heafod-leahtrum wiðinnan hreoflig bið cuman to Godes sacerde, and geopenian his digelnysse ðam gastlican læce, and be his ræde and fultume his sawle wunda dædbetende gelacnian
So also should he, who is leprous within with deadly sins, go to God's priest, and open his secret to the ghostly leech, and, by his counsel and aid, heal by penance the wounds of his soul

Sume men wenað þæt him genihtsumige to fulfremedum læcedome, gif hí heora synna mid onbryrdre heortan Gode ánum andettað, and ne ðurfon nanum sacerde geandettan, gif hí yfeles geswicað: ac gif heora wena soð wære, ðonne nolde Drihten asendan þone ðe he sylf gehælde to þam sacerde mid ænigre lace
Some men imagine that it will suffice for a complete cure, if, with compunction of heart, they confess their sins to God alone, and that they need not confess to any priest, if they cease from evil: but if their opinion were true, the Lord would not have sent him, whom he himself had healed, with any gift to the priest

For ðære ylcan gebisnunge eac hé asende Paulum, þone ðe he sylf of heofenum gespræc, to ðam sacerde Annanian, þus cweðende
For the same example he also sent Paul, whom he himself had spoken to from heaven, to the priest Ananias, thus saying

Ga inn to ðære ceastre, and ðær þe bið gesæd hwæt þe gedafenað to dónne
Go into the city, and there shall be told thee what it befitteth thee to do

Ne gedyde se sacerd þone man hreofligne oððe unhreofligne, ac hé démde þæt he sceolde beon ascyred fram manna neawiste, gif his hreofla wyrsigende wære, oððe betwux mannum wunian, gif his hreofla godigende wære
The priest made not the man leprous or unleprous, but he judged that he should be separated from the society of men, if his leprosy were growing worse, or should continue among men, if his leprosy were growing better

Swa sceal don se gastlica sacerd: he sceal gerihtlæcan Godes folc, and ðone ascyrian, and amánsumian fram cristenum mannum, þe swa hreoflig bið on mánfullum ðeawum þæt he oðre mid his yfelnysse besmit
So should the ghostly priest do: he should cure God's people, and separate, and excommunicate from christian men him who is so leprous with sinful practices that he infects others with his wickedness
